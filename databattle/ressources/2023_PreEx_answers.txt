Question 1 
You are a professional representative before the EPO. Today, 6 March 2023, you receive an email 
from your client, Alvar, a national of Finland. He wants you to file a European patent application 
EP-A in his name, claiming priority from FI-A, a Finnish patent application. FI-A was jointly filed in 
the name of Alvar and Aino on 4 March 2022. A copy of FI-A is attached to the email. No other 
document or information is sent with the email.  

1.1  On the basis of the information given above, you can file a European patent application EP-
A in Alvar's name at the EPO today and it will be accorded 6 March 2023 as the date of filing. 
TRUE: Since you can comply on 17 March 2023 with the requirements of Rule 40(1)(a), (b) 
and (c) EPC [i.e. providing an indication that a European patent is sought; providing your own or 
Alvar’s contact details; and filing the description of FI-A or a reference to it], the date of filing will be 
17 March 2023 (Guidelines, A-ll 4.1). 

1.2  You can validly file EP-A in Finnish. 
TRUE: A European patent application may be filed in any language, Article 14(2) EPC. 

1.3 
On the basis of the information given above, you can be sure that EP-A can validly claim 
priority from FI-A. 
FALSE: For validly claiming the priority, Aino must have transferred the priority right to Alvar 
(and Alvar must be the successor in title) before the filing date of EP-A, Article 87(1) EPC and 
Guidelines, A-lll, 6.1(ii). 

1.4  Alvar as a natural person is not entitled to a reduction of the filing fee. 
FALSE: Being a national of the Contracting State Finland and being a natural person, Alvar 
is entitled to a reduction of the filing fees, Rule 6(3) and (4)(b) EPC and Article 14(4) EPC. 



Question 2 
Paula is resident in Romania and has no EPO mailbox for electronic notification. On 13 February 
2023, Paula filed the European patent application EP-P as a first filing. The EPO noticed that the 
drawings mentioned in the description were missing. In a communication dated 22 February 2023, 
the EPO invited Paula to file the missing drawings.  

2.1  If applicants are not invited by the EPO to file missing parts of the description or missing 
drawings, they may validly file them within two months of the date of filing. 
TRUE: An applicant may file missing parts of the description or missing drawings of his own 
motion within two months of the date of filing, Rule 56(2) EPC and Guidelines, A-ll 5.2. 

2.2  If Paula ignores the invitation by the EPO to file missing parts of the description or missing 
drawings, EP-P will be deemed to be withdrawn. 
FALSE: If Paula ignores the invitation, then any reference to the drawings will be deemed to 
be deleted, Rule 56(4)(a) EPC (the legal consequence is not that the application is deemed to be 
withdrawn). 

2.3  If Paula files the missing drawings on 3 May 2023, EP-P will receive 3 May 2023 as its date 
of filing. 
TRUE: If the missing drawings are filed within two months of the notification of that 
communication [22 February + 10 days (4 March 2023) + 2 months], i.e. 4 May 2023 (Rule 56(1) 
EPC, Rule 126(2) EPC, Rule 131(4) EPC) the application shall be re-dated to the date on which 
the missing drawings were filed, Rule 56(2) EPC. 

2.4  Paula may validly file the missing drawings for EP-P on 6 June 2023, provided she pays the 
fee for further processing. 
FALSE: According to Rule 135(2) EPC, further processing is ruled out in respect of the 
period under Rule 56(2) EPC. 



Question 3 
Saïd intends to file the following patent applications in French language: 
(1) a European patent application EP-S 
(2) an international patent application PCT-SE. 
PCT-SE will be jointly filed in the name of Saïd and Eric. Eric lives in Paris. Saïd lives in Lebanon 
and is of Lebanese nationality. Lebanon is not a PCT member state.  

3.1  Saïd can validly file EP-S with the EPO. 
TRUE: There are no nationality or residence restrictions for filing a European patent 
application with the EPO, Articles 58 and 133(2) EPC. 

3.2  If, two months after validly filing PCT-SE, Saïd moves to Paris, the EPO will, upon request, 
record the change of residence in relation to PCT-SE. 
FALSE: Only the IB can record the residence change upon the applicant’s request, Rule 
92bis.1.(a)(i)PCT. 

3.3  PCT-SE can be validly filed with the EPO as receiving Office. 
TRUE: The EPO is the receiving Office competent for applicant Eric, who has his residence 
within one of the Contracting States (France), Article 151 EPC, Rule 157(1) EPC and Rule 19.1(a) 
PCT. If there are two (or more) applicants, the requirements of Rule 19.1 PCT regarding where to 
file are satisfied if the international application is filed with the competent receiving office of at least 
one of the applicants, Rule 19.2(i) PCT. 

3.4  PCT-SE can be validly filed with the International Bureau as receiving Office. 
TRUE: A PCT application can be validly filed before the International Bureau (IB) if at least 
one of the applicants is a resident or national of a PCT Contracting State, Rule 19.1(a)(iii) and Rule 

19.2  (ii) PCT. 



Question 4 
In 2020, company A was interested in exploiting a new medical device it had developed, and, for 
this purpose, details of the device were disclosed in confidence to company B. Unknown to 
company A, company B filed a European patent application EP-B with an effective filing date of 6 
June 2021. Made aware of the publication of EP-B, company A sought before a national court to 
be recognised as entitled to the grant of a European patent for the invention disclosed in EP-B. By 
a final decision of the national court dated 10 January 2023, it has been adjudged that company A 
is entitled to the grant of a European patent for the invention disclosed in EP-B. This final decision 
is recognised by all contracting states designated in the application EP-B.  

4.1  If EP-B is still pending and has not yet been granted, company A may prosecute EP-B as 
its own application in place of company B. 
TRUE: Article 61(1)(a), R. 16 EPC, Guidelines C-IX, 2.1(i) and A-IV, 2.1(i). 

4.2  If EP-B is still pending and has not yet been granted, a request that company B must 
withdraw EP-B, filed by company A at the EPO, will be allowed. 
FALSE: No provisions in Article 61(1)(c), Rule 16 EPC or elsewhere in the EPC are provided 
for the original application to be withdrawn by the unlawful applicant on request of the lawful 
applicant. 

4.3  If EP-B is still pending and has not yet been granted, company A may validly request that 
EP-B be refused. 
TRUE: Article 61(1)(c), R. 16  EPC, Guidelines C-IX, 2.1(iii) and A-IV, 2.1(iii) 

4.4  If EP-B has been deemed to be withdrawn and is thus no longer pending, company A may 
still file a new European patent application EP-A in respect of the same invention, wherein EP-A 
shall be deemed to have been filed on 6 June 2021. 
TRUE: Article 61(1)(b), R. 16  EPC, Guidelines C-IX, 2.2 and A-IV, 2.1(ii), G3/92 



Question 5 
On 31 January 2022, Susanne, a German national living in Germany, filed a PCT application PCT-
S in German, validly claiming priority from her European patent application EP-S, filed on 
29 January 2021 in German. PCT-S contains claim 1 as originally disclosed in EP-S and claim 2 
directed to an improved embodiment that was not disclosed in EP-S. PCT-S was published in 
German on 7 August 2022. Susanne sold PCT-S to Ian, a British national. The international search 
report issued by the EPO as International Searching Authority states that claim 1 is not novel over 
the prior art and the subject-matter of claim 2 is novel and involves an inventive step. Ian wants to 
enter the regional phase before the EPO for PCT-S. Today is 6 March 2023. 

5.1  When entering the regional phase before the EPO, Ian can file an English translation of 
PCT-S so that the language of the proceedings of the regional phase of PCT-S will be English. 
FALSE: If an international patent application has been filed and published under the PCT in 
an official language of the EPO, it is not possible, on entry into the European phase, to file a 
translation of the application into another EPO official language (G 4/08). 

5.2  The time limit for entering the regional phase before the EPO for PCT-S claiming priority 
from EP-S ends on 31 July 2023. 
FALSE: Calculating 31 months from priority date, the time limit for entering the regional 
phase before the EPO for PCT-S ends on 29 August 2023 (Rule 159(1) EPC). 

5.3  Today, 6 March 2023, Ian can withdraw the priority claim of PCT-S in the international 
phase so that the time limit for entering the regional phase before the EPO for PCT-S expires on  
2 September 2024. 
TRUE: The priority claim of PCT-S can be withdrawn in the international phase until 29 
January 2021 + 30 months (Rule 90bis.3 PCT) -> 29 July 2023 (Saturday) -> 31 July 2023. The 
time limit for entry into EP-phase becomes  31 January 2022 + 31 months (Rule 159(1) EPC) -> 31 
August 2024 (Saturday) -> 2 September 2024. 
This statement has been neutralized, because the calendar for 2024 was not made available to the 
candidates. 

5.4  Withdrawing the priority claim of EP-S will affect the effective date of claim 2. 
FALSE: Claim 2 was not disclosed in EP-S, the priority is not valid for this claim, and the 
effective date of this claim is the filing date of PCT-S (Article 88(3) EPC). 



Question 6 
European patent application EP-P was filed as a first filing on 2 December 2019 and was published 
on 13 June 2021. On 28 November 2021, you received the first communication from the examining 
division under Article 94(3) EPC regarding EP-P. European patent application EP-D was filed with 
the EPO on 8 December 2022 as a divisional application of EP-P. Today, 6 March 2023, EP-P is 
still pending. Some of the claims of EP-D contain subject-matter that was not originally disclosed in 
EP-P. The renewal fees for EP-D have not yet been paid. 

6.1  An EP divisional application cannot be validly filed after 24 months from the issuance of the 
first communication under Article 94(3) EPC in respect of EP-P and therefore EP-D was not validly 
filed as a divisional application. 
FALSE: The European divisional application EP-D can be validly filed as long as the earlier 
application (in this case EP-P) is pending, Rule 36(1) EPC as entered into force on 01.04.2014. 
(Since this change, Rule 36(1)(a) EPC as entered into force on 26 October 2010 is not applicable 
anymore). 

6.2  The renewal fee, already fallen due, may be validly paid for EP-D on 11 April 2023 without 
an additional fee. 
TRUE: The first to fourth renewal fee was due in respect of EP-P when EP-D was filed, the 
5th renewal fee was not due when EP-D was filed. This 5th renewal fee for EP-P became due on 31 
December 2022. Renewal fees already due in respect of EP-P at the date of filing EP-D shall be 
also paid for EP-D and shall be due on its filing. These fees and any renewal fee due within four 
months of filing EP-D can be paid within four months from filing without an additional fee, i.e. on 11 
April 2023 [8 December 2022 + 4 months (= 8 April 2023), extended to Tuesday 11 April 2023], 
Rule 51(3) EPC, Rule 131(4) EPC and Rule 134(1) EPC)] 

6.3  At present, EP-D is deemed to have 8 December 2022 as its date of filing. 
FALSE: Even if EP-D contains subject-matter extending beyond the content of the earlier 
application as originally filed, it cannot be converted into an independent application taking 8 
December 2022 as its date of filing (Article 76(1) EPC, Guidelines C-IX, 1.4 or G1/05, Reasons 11.1). 

6.4  In the present case EP-P will be regarded as prior art under Article 54(2) EPC against EP-D. 
FALSE: EP-P cannot be prior art for EP-D, because EP-D cannot be converted into an 
independent application and has the same filing date or priority of EP-P with respect to the same 
subject-matter of EP-P (Article 76(1) EPC, Guidelines C-IX, 1.4 or G1/05, Reasons 11.1). 



Question 7 
A company having its principal place of business in France files an international patent application 
at the French national patent office. The language of this international patent application is English. 
As a receiving Office, the French national patent office accepts international patent applications 
filed in French only. The International Searching Authority for this international patent application is 
the European Patent Office, which accepts the following languages for international search: 
English, French and German.  

7.1  The international patent application will be transmitted to the International Bureau. 
TRUE: The international patent application is not in a language accepted by the French 
national patent office, therefore the French national patent office will transmit the international 
patent application to the International Bureau (Rule 19.4 (b) PCT) 

7.2  The international patent application will be considered to have been received by the French 
national patent office on behalf of the International Bureau as receiving Office. 
TRUE: Rule 19.4 (a)(ii) PCT 

7.3  The search fee is collected by the International Searching Authority for its own benefit. 
FALSE: The search fee is collected by the receiving Office (Rule 16.1 (b) PCT). 

7.4  A translation is required by the European Patent Office for the international search. 
FALSE: No translation is required since English is a language accepted by the EPO for 
international search (Rule 12.3 (a) PCT, Euro-PCT Guide 3.1.015) 



Question 8 
A European patent application, EP-A, was filed in English on 2 September 2021 claiming priority 
from a Swedish national patent application, SE-A, which was filed on 2 September 2020. EP-A was 
published on 9 March 2022. EP-A is pending. 

8.1  The European examination proceedings are in progress. Third-party observations written in 
English are filed today and explain why a scientific journal article published in Swedish on  
10 August 2020 is novelty-destroying for the claimed subject-matter of EP-A. The third-party 
observations are filed anonymously at the European Patent Office, together with a copy of the 
Swedish publication. 
In view of this, the third-party observations are validly filed. 
TRUE: The third-party observations may be anonymous. Any person may present 
observations concerning the patentability of the invention including the novelty. The observations 
are filed in writing in English which is one of the EPO’s official languages. (Art. 115 EPC, 
Guidelines A-VII,3.5 and E-VI,3)  
Publications submitted in support of the arguments may be filed in any language  
(Rule 114(1) EPC, Rule 3(3) EPC, Guidelines E-VI,3). 

8.2  Third-party observations must cite prior art documents. 
FALSE: Third-party observations may be directed to any observations concerning the 
patentability of the invention (Article 115 EPC, Guidelines E-VI, 3), for instance Articles 83, 84 and 
123(2) EPC. 

8.3  The decision to grant a patent based on EP-A has already been sent to the applicant. Third-
party observations are received by the EPO just before the publication of the mention of the grant. 
They cite a new document destroying the novelty of the allowed claims.  
In view of this, the examining division will consider them and resume the examination proceedings. 
FALSE: Observations by third parties received after the decision to grant the application has 
been issued in written proceedings (see G 12/91) will be included in the file without taking note of 
their content. (Guidelines E-VI, 3) 

8.4  A patent based on EP-A has been granted. The mention of the grant was published on 1 
March 2023. Third-party observations are validly filed today. 
In view of this, the person filing the third-party observations will be a party to the opposition 
proceedings if opposition proceedings start. 
FALSE: Third parties who have presented observations concerning the patentability of the 
invention of the patent are not parties to opposition proceedings (Art. 115 EPC, last sentence and 
Guidelines D-I,6). 



Question 9 
When filing a European patent application with 14 claims, the applicant also submits a request for 
examination by filing the written request and paying the examination fee. The European Patent 
Bulletin mentions the publication of the European search report on 20 January 2023. The 
European search opinion states that claim 1 lacks novelty. The applicant receives an invitation 
under Rule 70(2) and Rule 70a(2) EPC dated 13 February 2023 setting a time limit of six months 
running from the publication of the European search report. 

9.1  The application shall be deemed to be withdrawn if the applicant files a reply to the 
invitation on 14 August 2023. 
TRUE: Where the applicant is invited to submit the indication provided for in Rule 70(2) 
EPC, a six-month time limit running from the publication of the search report applies,  
Rules 70(3) + 70a(3) EPC, GL E VIII 1.2. Final date is 20 July 2023. 

9.2  If the applicant omits in his timely reply to the European search opinion to indicate that he 
wishes to proceed further with the application, the application is deemed to be withdrawn. 
FALSE: The applicant's response to the search opinion is interpreted as the confirmation 
required by Rule 70(2) EPC, even where not explicitly expressed as such, Guidelines C-II 1.1. 

9.3  The applicant can validly file a request for accelerated examination before timely filing of a 
valid reply to the invitation. 
FALSE: Accelerated examination can, in principle, be requested at any time after the 
examining division has assumed responsibility for the application E-VIII, 4.2. Rule 10(3) EPC: If a 
request for examination is filed before the European search report has been transmitted to the 
applicant, the Examining Division shall be responsible from the time when the European Patent 
Office receives the indication under Rule 70 (2) EPC. 

4.2 ., Regel 10 (3) EPÜ: Wird ein Prüfungsantrag gestellt, bevor dem Anmelder der europäische 
Recherchenbericht übermittelt wurde, so ist die Prüfungsabteilung ab dem Zeitpunkt zuständig, an 
dem die Erklärung nach Regel 70 (2) EPÜ beim Europäischen Patentamt eingeht. 
FAUX : 
En principe, un examen accéléré peut être demandé à tout moment une fois que la 
division d’examen est devenue compétente pour la demande E-VIII, 4.2. Règle 10(3) CBE : Si une 
requête en examen est présentée avant que le rapport de recherche européenne ait été transmis 
au demandeur, la division d'examen est compétente dès que l'Office européen des brevets reçoit 
la déclaration visée à la règle 70(2). 

9.4  If the applicant validly replies to the invitation and files three additional claims, he must pay 
the claims fees for two claims within one month of filing the claims. 
FALSE: Rule 71(4) EPC defines that if the European patent application in the text intended 
for grant comprises more than fifteen claims, the Examining Division shall invite the applicant to 
pay claims fees in respect of the sixteenth and each subsequent claim. 



Question 10 
Applicant Andrew names Berta as sole inventor in his European patent application EP-A. 

10.1  The EPO informs Berta in a communication about her designation as inventor in the 
European patent application EP-A. 
FALSE: No provision anymore in Rule 19 EPC. 

10.2  Berta can waive her right to be mentioned as inventor in the published European patent 
application EP-A. 
TRUE: Rule 20(1) EPC 

10.3  If Carla was incorrectly designated as inventor in the European patent application EP-A, 
there is no way to request rectification of the incorrect designation. 
FALSE: Rule 21 EPC 

10.4  Berta can pay any fees to the EPO. 
TRUE: Anyone can pay the fees to the EPO (Guidelines A-X, 1). 



Question 11 

11.1  Claim I.1 covers the second embodiment. 
TRUE: The claim language “comprises” covers additional layers such as the reinforcement 
layer of the second embodiment. 

11.2  Claim I.1 covers the third embodiment. 
TRUE: The fibres of claim I.1 are not limited to a particular form and cover the web, loops and 
upstanding ends of the third embodiment. 

11.3  Claim I.4 is disclosed in the application as filed. 
TRUE: As the claims are part of the application as filed and the combination of features is 
covered by the claims due to the claim dependency. 

11.4  Claim I.3 covers all alternatives of the first embodiment.  
FALSE: As the cleaning utensil in accordance with claim I.3 is limited to one specific fibre 
material comprising polypropylene, whereas other alternatives of the first embodiment encompass 
other alternative fibre materials (see [008] of the description). 



Question 12 

12.1  Claim I.1 meets the requirements of Article 123(2) EPC. 
FALSE: The description includes only embodiments of a cleaning cloth, the genus cleaning 
utensil of claim I.1 is broader than the species cleaning cloth, see [002] of the description, so that 
claim I.1 includes other types of cleaning utensil with the further features recited in claim I.1 which 
are not disclosed in the application as filed. 

12.2  Claim I.4 meets the requirements of Article 123(2) EPC. 
FALSE: As only the combination of a web and loops or upstanding ends is disclosed in the 
application as filed, in [005] of the description. 

12.3  Claim I.5 meets the requirements of Article 123(2) EPC. 
TRUE: The combination of features is disclosed in the third embodiment of Figure 3 in [005] of 
the description. 

12.4 Claim I.6 meets the requirements of Article 123(2) EPC. 
FALSE: The combination of the reinforcing layer of the second embodiment with the web and 
loops or upstanding ends of the third embodiment is not disclosed in the application as filed. 



Question 13 

13.1  The subject matter of claim I.1 is novel over D1. 
FALSE: D1 discloses a cleaning cloth (a species of a cleaning utensil) with a first layer 12 
comprising a sponge material and a second layer 11 comprising fibres. 

13.2  The subject matter of claim I.3 is novel over D1. 
FALSE: D1 discloses fibres comprising polypropylene in layer 13. 

13.3  The subject matter of claim I.4 is novel over D1. 
TRUE: D1 fails to disclose fibres having loops or upstanding ends. 

13.4  The subject matter of claim I.7 is novel over D1. 
FALSE: D1 discloses ranges of 20 to 35 decitex and at least 150 decitex which overlap with the 
ranges equal to 25 or less decitex and at least 100 decitex (Guidelines G-VI, 8(iii)). 



Question 14 

14.1  An objective technical problem solved by the subject-matter of claim I.2 over D1 can be 
formulated as how to provide a material for releasing water into the first layer to increase the 
cleaning efficiency. 
FALSE: The distinguishing feature of claim I.2 over D1 is that the sponge is a synthetic sponge. 
The patent application discloses the technical effect of releasing water into the first layer to 
increase the cleaning efficiency for sponge material in general and not that this is a technical effect 
specifically disclosed in connection with synthetic sponges. 

14.2  Using the problem-solution approach applied to the subject-matter of claim II.1, an objective 
technical problem can be formulated as how to improve the cleaning action of a layer comprising 
fibres. 
TRUE: The subject-matter of claim II.1 distinguishes over D1 in that the second portion of the 
fibers has upstanding ends or loops protruding upwardly from the web. The technical effect of the 
distinguishing features is disclosed in [005] of the description  as providing more abrasive cleaning 
of a surface and also capture dirt removed from the surface thus improving the clean efficiency.  

14.3 Using the problem-solution approach applied to the subject-matter of claim II.1, an objective 
technical problem can be formulated as how to provide a more abrasive cleaning action. 
TRUE: The subject-matter of claim II.1 distinguishes over D1 in that the second portion of the 
fibers has upstanding ends or loops protruding upwardly from the web. The technical effect of the 
distinguishing features is disclosed in [005] of the description as providing more abrasive cleaning 
of a surface and also capture dirt removed from the surface thus improving the clean efficiency. 

14.4  A valid argument that the cleaning utensil of claim III.1 involves an inventive step is that the 
claimed ranges of the fibre portions are not obvious from D1 since D1 gives the skilled person no 
hint at a technical advantage associated with a larger portion of lighter fibres so that the skilled 
person would not increase the portion of the lighter fibres to more than the maximum 64% 
disclosed in D1. 
TRUE: Indeed, D1 does not disclose any technical effect associated with respect to the 
amount of the lighter fibres in its cleaning cloth. Thus, in the present case this is one example of a 
valid argument to support the inventive step of claim III.1.  



Question 15 

15.1  Claim I.1, amended during examination proceedings as follows (amendments are 
underlined), meets the requirement of Article 123(2) EPC: 
Cleaning utensil comprising: 
a first layer comprising a sponge material; 
a second layer comprising fibres; and 
a reinforcement layer arranged between the first layer and the second layer, wherein the 
reinforcement layer comprises a sponge material. 
FALSE: The sponge material of the reinforcement layer 5 is only disclosed with features of the 
water absorbing capacity relative to the sponge layer 3 – the amendment has resulted in an 
intermediate generalisation as the features of the water absorbing capacity relative to the sponge 
layer 3 have been omitted. 

15.2  Claim I.2, amended during examination proceedings as follows (amendments are 
underlined), meets the requirement of Article 123(2) EPC: 
Cleaning utensil according to claim I.1, wherein the cleaning utensil is a cleaning cloth and the 
sponge material comprises a synthetic or a natural sponge. 
FALSE: The “natural sponge” is mentioned in the description in [008] referring to the first, 
second and third embodiments. All these embodiments require that cleaning utensil comprises 
woven fibres. Claim I.2 omits the presence of woven fibres, and thus the amendment of claim I.2 
results in an unallowable intermediate generalization. 

15.3  Claim I.3, amended during examination proceedings as follows (amendments are 
underlined), meets the requirement of Article 123(2) EPC: 
Cleaning utensil according to claim I.1, wherein the fibres comprise polypropylene a polymer. 
FALSE: Only examples of specific polymers are disclosed in [008] in the description. A 
generalization to any polymer contravenes the requirements of Article 123(2) EPC. 

15.4  Claim I.7, amended during examination proceedings in such a way that it is dependent on 
claim I.5, meets the requirement of Article 123(2) EPC. 
TRUE: The subject-matter of claim I.7 corresponds to the third embodiment described in [005] 
to [007] of the description. 



Question 16 

16.1  The following feature is described as essential in the description: The erasable ink 
composition comprises from about 1.5% to about 30% w/w of the colouring agent by weight of the 
erasable ink composition. 
FALSE: In [005] of the description of the application, the mentioned ranges are preferred 
ranges. This means that the range of 1.5 to 30.0 % w/w is not an essential feature of the invention. 

16.2  The following feature is described as essential in the description: The releasing agent is a 
modified siloxane. 
FALSE: [006] of the description of the application states that the erasing can be even further 
improved when the releasing agent includes a modified siloxane. Thus, the provision of modified 
siloxane is not an essential feature for ensuring the erasing. 

16.3  The following feature is described as essential in the description: The modified siloxane-
containing releasing agent comprises less than 1% w/w of colloidal silica. 
TRUE: In [006] of the description of the application it is stated that the releasing agent 
should always contain less than 1% w/w of colloidal silica, when the releasing agent includes the 
modified siloxane. 
FALSE: The provision of modified siloxane is not an essential feature as discussed in 16.2 
above. 
Both answers are possible depending on the interpretation of the statement. 

16.4  The following feature is described as essential in the description: The polymeric binder is a 
polyvinyl butyral resin. 
FALSE: [008] of the description of the application states that the polymeric binder is a resin. 
The polyvinyl butyral resin is just one of the alternative resins (PVC, PVB, etc.) mentioned. 



Question 17 

17.1  Claim I.1bis, if filed as envisaged, would meet the requirement of Article 123(2) EPC. 
FALSE: Claim I.1bis is not completely supported in [004] of the description of the application, 
as an essential element is missing, i.e. a releasing agent. 

17.2  Claim I.4 meets the requirement of Article 84 EPC. 
FALSE: Claim I.4 defines the lower limit for the colouring agent to be 0.5% w/w. However, 
paragraph 5 of the description of the application teaches that the erasable ink has to contain more 
than 0.75% w/w of the colouring agent, since the colour intensity would be too weak. Therefore, 
the essential feature of the colouring agent containing more than 0.75% w/w is missing. 

17.3  Claim I.5 contains all the essential features. 
FALSE: When the releasing agent comprises a modified siloxane, it should contain less than 
1% of colloidal silica by the weight of the erasable ink composition (paragraph 6 of the description 
of the application). 

17.4 
Claim I.8bis, if filed as envisaged, would meet the requirement of Article 123(2) EPC. 
TRUE: Claim I.8bis is based claim I.8 further specifying the amount of water to be from 
about 40% to about 90% w/w. This specific range for the amount of water is explicitly disclosed in 
paragraph 9 of the description as one of the several optional features in combination with the 
embodiments of the application as filed (Guidelines H-V, 3.2, G-VI, 8(i)). 



Question 18 

18.1  Claim I.1 is novel over D1. 
FALSE: While D1 directed to a solvent system with an organic ester, D1 discloses in the 
introduction what is commonly known in the field of erasable ink composition. D1 discloses in 
paragraph 2 a water-based erasable ink comprising a pigment, i.e. a colouring agent and a 
releasing agent. 

18.2  Claim I.1 is novel over D2. 
FALSE: D2 discloses an erasable ink composition ([001]) comprising: (a) water ([002]), (b) a 
colouring agent ([002]; pigment = colouring agent), (c) and a releasing agent ([003]) . Thus, all the 
features of claim I.1 are disclosed in D2 and the subject-matter of claim I.1 is not novel over D2. 

18.3  Claim I.3 is novel over D2. 
FALSE: D2 discloses an erasable ink composition ([001]) comprising: (a) water ([002]), (b) a 
colouring agent ([002]; pigment = colouring agent), (c) a releasing agent ([003], since the 
dispersant of D2 has a releasing effect) and a film-forming polymeric binder ([003], since the 
dispersant is a water-soluble polymer that includes polymeric chains and has the effect of forming 
a film). D2 does not explicitly disclose that the water is present in an amount ranging from about 40 
to about 90% w/w, however it discloses an overlapping range, i.e. about 74% to about 94% w/w 
([002] of D2). According to the GL G VI-8, the criteria mentioned in relation to selection inventions 
can be applied analogously for assessing the novelty of overlapping numerical ranges (see 
T 17/85), i.e. (a) is the selected sub-range narrower compared to the known range; and (b) is the 
selected sub-range sufficiently far removed from any specific examples disclosed in the prior art 
and from the end-points of the known range. This is not the case here, thus, the subject-matter of 
claim I.3 is not novel over D2. 
The description in [002] of the application mentions that water-based ink are based on using water 
as a solvent rather than using other solvents. This means that “water-based” corresponds to 
“water". 

18.4  Claim I.6 is novel over D2. 
TRUE: D2 does not disclose an erasable ink composition comprising the polyvinyl butyral 
resin being present in an amount ranging from about 1 to 15% w/w. 



Question 19 

19.1  D1 mentions that water in the solvent system has disadvantages. 
FALSE: D1 discloses a solvent system which does not comprise water. D1 mentions 
generally other types of commonly known solvents without excluding other solvents. Thus, D1 
does not mention explicitly that water has disadvantages as a solvent. 

19.2  D1 teaches that an essential element of all erasable ink compositions is the presence of a 
releasing agent. 
FALSE: D1 discloses that the commonly known erasable ink composition may comprise a 
releasing agent ([002]), but among the specific features related to the product of D1 ([004]), no 
releasing agent is listed. Thus, D1 does not teach that a releasing agent is an essential feature of 
any erasable ink composition. 

19.3  D2 discloses a pen that contains an erasable ink composition. 
TRUE: D2 explicitly refers to a pen as a writing instrument ([002]). Furthermore, D2 is an 
editorial paper published in Pen Technology. Thus, D2 does teach explicitly that a pen contains the 
erasable ink composition. 

19.4  D2 does not teach that the erasability of the erasable ink composition is dependent on the 
drying time. 
TRUE: D2 does not mention the drying time or any dependency on time of the erasable ink 
composition. Thus, D2 does not teach that the erasable ink composition is dependent on the drying 
time. 



Question 20 

20.1  In an opposition procedure, an opponent will likely be successful with a novelty attack 
against claim II.1 over D2. 
TRUE: D2 discloses an erasable ink composition comprising : (a) from about 74 to about 
94% w/w of water (overlapping with the range from II.1); (b) from 5 to 20% w/w of the flake-like 
pigment (overlapping with the range from II.1.); (c) from 1 to 4% w/w of dispersant/releasing 
agent/film forming polymer (once more overlapping with the range from II.1). Note that the 
releasing agent of D2 also play the role of a film-forming polymeric binder ([003]). According to the 
GL G VI-8, the criteria mentioned in relation to selection inventions can be applied analogously for 
assessing the novelty of overlapping numerical ranges (see T 17/85), i.e. (a) is the selected sub-
range narrower compared to the known range; and (b) is the selected sub-range sufficiently far 
removed from any specific examples disclosed in the prior art and from the end-points of the 
known range. Although here we have four overlapping ranges, the ranges are neither narrower nor 
far removed from the end-points of the known ranges. Please further note that feature (d) of claim 
II.1 is optional. Thus, claim II. 1 would not be new over D2. 

20.2  In an opposition procedure, an opponent will likely be successful with a novelty attack 
against claim II.2 over D1. 
FALSE: D1 does not disclose an erasable ink composition comprising a modified siloxane as 
a releasing agent. 

20.3  In an opposition procedure, an opponent will likely be successful with an attack under 
Article 83 EPC against claim II.3. 
FALSE: Claim II.3 has rather a clarity problem (Article 84 EPC, which is not a ground for 
opposition), as it lacks the essential features to achieve the effect sought. However, the application 
(as required by Article 83 EPC) does provide the teaching to carry out the invention as exemplified 
in [011] of the description (Guideline F-III, 1). 

20.4 
In an opposition procedure, an opponent will likely be successful with an attack under 
Article 123(2) EPC against claim II.2. 
TRUE: The application explicitly states that when the releasing agent includes a modified siloxane, 
it should contain less than 1% w/w of colloidal silica (paragraph 6 of the description). Claim II.2, 
however, is not limited to comprise any colloidal silica, although the claimed erasable ink 
composition comprises a modified siloxane. An erasable ink composition comprising a modified 
siloxane without any colloidal silica is not directly and unambiguously derivable from the application 
as originally filed.
