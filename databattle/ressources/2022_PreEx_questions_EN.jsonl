Yoga mats are thin, soft mats which are easily rolled and transported to allow the \nathlete to use them in various locations. Once rolled out on the floor, a yoga mat has a \nlength of 1.5 to 2.2 metres and a width of 0.6 to 1.0 metres. Described herein is an improved yoga mat. \n[002] In an embodiment, we provide a yoga mat with a first colour on a first face and a \ndifferent second colour on the second face. When the yoga mat is rolled out and in use, \nthe first face is in contact with the floor and the second face is in contact with the athlete. \nThis allows the athlete to always use the yoga mat such that the same face of the yoga \nmat is in contact with the floor. \n[003] In an embodiment, the first face of the yoga mat has a coating of material which \nprovides secure but reversible adhesion of the yoga mat onto the floor. Preferably, the \nmaterial is poly-X. The material covers 10 to 100% of the first face. \n[004] In an embodiment, the yoga mat contains antibacterial material, such as e.g. silver \nions on the second face, so as to reduce the growth of bacteria. \n[005] In an embodiment, the second face contains a material which reduces the generation of sweat on the athlete’s body. We have found that poly-Y is a highly suitable material, since it provides improved reduction of sweat generation on the body of the athlete \nwhile the athlete is in contact with the mat. Using our new special secret test protocol we \nestablished a sweat reduction value (SRV) of 100 for yoga mats made of poly-Y. Higher \nSRVs correspond to a higher level of sweat reduction. For yoga mats made of poly-X the \nSRV is 84, and for yoga mats made of poly-Z the SRV is 93. In an embodiment of the invention the yoga mat has an SRV of 90 or more. \n[006] In an embodiment, we provide the yoga mat with a very fashionable, fully organic \ntextile container made from slow-growing cotton.\nClaims filed together with the above European patent application: \n", "Choix5": "1. \nYoga mat having a first face and a second face. \n", "Choix6": "2. \nYoga mat according to claim 1, wherein the first face and the second face are distinguishable. \n", "Choix7": "3. \nYoga mat according to claim 2, wherein the first face has a first colour and the \nsecond face has a second colour different from the first colour. \n", "Choix8": "4. \nYoga mat according to any of claims 1 to 3, wherein, in use, the first face is in \ncontact with the floor and the second face is in contact with the athlete. \n", "Choix9": "5. \nYoga mat according to any of claims 1 to 4, wherein the first face has a coating of \nmaterial, said material providing secure but reversible adhesion of the mat onto \nthe floor. \n", "Choix10": "6. \nYoga mat according to claim 5, wherein the material is poly-X. \n", "Choix11": "7. \nYoga mat according to any of claims 1 to 6, wherein the second face contains an \nantibacterial material. \n", "Choix12": "8. \nYoga mat according to any of claims 1 to 6, wherein the second face of the yoga \nmat contains silver ions. \n", "Choix13": "9. \nYoga mat according to claim 6, wherein the material covers 10 to 100% of the first \nface. \n", "Choix14": "10. \nYoga mat according to any of claims 1 to 9, wherein the second face contains a \nmaterial, preferably poly-Y, wherein the material is such that upon contact with \nthe athlete’s body it reduces the generation of sweat on the athlete’s body. \n", "Choix15": "11. \nTextile bag for completely covering and for transporting yoga mats. \n", "Choix16": "12. \nThe textile bag of claim 11, containing the yoga mat according to any of claims 1 \nto 10. \n", "Choix17": "13. \nThe textile bag of claim 12, wherein the bag is made from fully organic material \nwhich grows relatively slowly. \n", "Choix18": "14. \nUse of poly-Y in the production of yoga mats. \nAssume in the following that documents D1, D2, D3, and D4 are prior art in accordance \nwith Art. 54(1) and (2) EPC: \nD1: \nThis document discloses a yoga mat.

Description of a second European patent application \n[001] The present invention aims at preserving wine (or other alcoholic beverages like \nbeer or other beverages having 10 vol.% alcohol or more) that remains in a bottle once \nthe bottle has been opened but not all the wine in the bottle has been consumed. Oxygen from the air that remains in the bottle, in the space between the wine level and the \nopening of the bottle (the so-called “headspace”), causes oxidation of the wine. The oxidation of the wine renders the wine unpleasant in taste. \n[002] A device for preserving wine is known from D11. This device consists of a handactuated vacuum pump that is used to remove air (and therefore also oxygen) from the \nheadspace of the opened bottle. A disadvantage of this device is that the volatile aroma \nsubstances included in the wine are also removed by the pumping process. Another disadvantage is that many hand actuations are necessary to remove sufficient air from the \nheadspace. \n[003] The present invention provides a device that instead of creating a vacuum simply \nreplaces air (and therefore also oxygen) in the headspace with another gas comprising \nless oxygen than air. A preferred other gas is an inert gas. This is achieved by injecting \nthe other gas (e.g. the inert gas) into the headspace. The injected gas pushes the air out \nof the headspace. \n[004] By inert gas we mean a gas that does not undergo any chemical reaction with the \nvolatile aroma substances included in the wine. Examples of inert gases are carbon dioxide, nitrogen and argon. Argon is the most preferred inert gas, because it is heavier \nthan oxygen and heavier than air, so that a layer of argon creates a “gas cap” on top of \nthe wine level. Even a very small volume of argon is sufficient to create the gas cap and \nprevent the oxidation processes. \nClaims filed together with the second European patent application: \nII.1. \nMethod for preserving wine in a bottle, wherein the composition of a gas in the \nheadspace of the bottle is modified. \nII.2. \nMethod for preserving an alcoholic beverage in a bottle, wherein the amount of \noxygen in the headspace of the bottle is reduced. \nII.3. \nMethod for preserving an alcoholic beverage according to claim II.2, wherein an \ninert gas is injected directly into the headspace of the bottle. \nII.4. \nMethod for preserving an alcoholic beverage according to claim II.3, wherein the \ninert gas is carbon dioxide. \nII.5. \nMethod for preserving an alcoholic beverage according to claim II.3 or II.4, \nwherein the inert gas is exclusively nitrogen. \nII.6. \nMethod for preserving an alcoholic beverage according to claim II.3, wherein the \ninert gas is a mixture of carbon dioxide with nitrogen or with argon. \nII.7. \nMethod for preserving an alcoholic beverage according to claim II.3, wherein the \ninert gas is argon. \nII.8. \nMethod for preserving an alcoholic beverage according to claim II.5, wherein the \nalcoholic beverage is wine and the wine is contained in an opened bottle. \nII.9. \nMethod for preserving an alcoholic beverage according to claim II.7, wherein the \nalcoholic beverage is wine and the wine is contained in an opened bottle.\nAssume in the following that documents D11, D12, and D13 are prior art in accordance \nwith Art. 54(1) and (2) EPC: \nDocument D11 \n[001] This document discloses a vacuum pump that is used to extract air or oxygen from \nan opened bottle in order to preserve the wine contained in the opened bottle. \n[002] The principle is very simple. The opened bottle is closed with a water-tight and airtight reusable stopper. The stopper is easily applied onto the neck of the bottle to hermetically seal the opening of the bottle. The stopper can be easily removed again from \nthe bottle by hand. The stopper has a one-way valve through which air and oxygen from \nwithin the bottle can be extracted using a vacuum pump. In this way the quality of the \nwine in the opened bottle can be preserved for many days.\nDocument D12 \n[001] Devices for household use are known for introducing carbon dioxide into water. \nCarbon dioxide is a gas that is contained in a pressurized capsule within the device. \nOnce carbon dioxide is released into water, the gas and the water undergo a chemical \nreaction to provide carbonic acid, which gives water pleasant taste and fizz. With the \nhelp of such devices sparkling water can be prepared inexpensively from tap water. \n[002] We have now found that the same devices can be used to inject the carbon dioxide into wine. When carbon dioxide is injected into wine, a similar chemical reaction occurs as when carbon dioxide is added to water. Thereby a pleasant fizz is added to the \nwine. We have additionally noted that a part of the injected carbon dioxide reaches the \nheadspace of the bottle and pushes the air (and therefore also oxygen) contained \ntherein out of the headspace of the bottle. Moreover, we found that wine can be better \npreserved when carbon dioxide is injected therein.\nDocument D13 \n[001] This document discloses an industrial method for preserving liquids. It is known \nthat fish oil is easily spoiled by oxygen upon storage. The method consists of injecting \nnitrogen into the headspace of a bottle filled with fish oil before closing the bottle and \ntransporting such bottles to the various points of sale. \n[002] It is known by the skilled person that nitrogen is lighter than oxygen. Therefore, the \nnitrogen must be injected just above the level of the fish oil within the bottle. Nitrogen \nevacuates through the opening of the bottle, but some oxygen is removed as well. After \ninjecting a volume of nitrogen equal to 20 times of the volume of the headspace into the \nheadspace of the bottle, virtually no oxygen can be traced in the headspace of the bottle. \n[003] Clearly, this method can be applied to many types of liquid, such as perfumes and \nbeer.\n"}
