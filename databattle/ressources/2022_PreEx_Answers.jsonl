True: D13 discloses in paragraphs [002] and [003] a method for preserving an alcoholic \nbeverage (beer) wherein the concentration of oxygen in the headspace of the bot-\ntle is reduced, wherein an inert gas is introduced into the headspace of the bottle, \nand wherein the inert gas is only nitrogen. \n"}
{"Question18": "", "Choix1": " The EPO may issue a communication under Rule 62a EPC in the search phase for the present set of claims. \n", "Answer1": "TRUE: Yes, claim II.1 and claim II.2 are independent method claims and relate to alter-\nnative subject-matter, i.e. Rule 62a EPC applies. \n", "Choix2": " The subject-matter of claim II.5 is clear. ", "Answer2": "FALSE: Claim II.5 is unclear since on the one hand the inert gas is specified as being \nonly nitrogen, but on the other hand claim II.5 is dependent on claim II.4 wherein \nthe inert gas is carbon dioxide. \n", "Choix3": " The presence of an inert gas is described in the application documents as an es-sential feature. \n", "Answer3": "FALSE: The presence of an inert gas is only a preferred feature and not an essential \nfeature (see paragraph [003] of the description). \n", "Choix4": " The subject-matter of claim II.6 can be introduced into the description without contravening Article 123(2) EPC. \n", "Answer4": "TRUE: The subject-matter of claim II.6 is part of the application as filed and can be \nadded to the description without contravening Article 123(2) EPC. \n"}
{"Question19": "", "Choix1": " Amending claim II.7 to recite “Method for preserving an alcoholic beverage ac-cording to claim II.3, wherein the inert gas is a noble gas” would not be allowable \nunder Article 123(2) EPC. \n", "Answer1": "TRUE: There is no reference to a noble gas in the application. As such claim 6 cannot \nbe directed to noble gases without contravening Article 123(2) EPC. \n", "Choix2": " Although argon is described as the most preferred inert gas, deleting all refer-ences to argon from the claims would be allowable under Article 123(2) EPC. \n", "Answer2": "TRUE: Deletion of a preferred option does not add subject-matter, in particular if the de-\nscription shows other ways to achieve the claimed subject-matter.  \n", "Choix3": " Amending claim II.3 to recite “Method for preserving an alcoholic beverage ac-cording to claim II.2, wherein an inert gas is directly injected into the headspace of \nthe bottle to create a gas cap on top of the wine level” would be allowable under \nArticle 123(2) EPC. \nFalse: The amendment in claim 3 is an intermediate generalisation, since the gas cap is \ndisclosed only for argon, and not for all other inert gases. \n", "Choix4": " Amending claim II.2 to recite “Method for preserving an alcoholic beverage having 10 vol.% alcohol or more, wherein the amount of oxygen in the headspace of the \nbottle is reduced” would be allowable under Article 123 (2) EPC. \n", "Answer4": "TRUE: The amendment in claim 2 “including 10 vol% alcohol or more” is based on para-\ngraph [001] of the present application. Although the amended claim II.2 omits the \nexpression “in the bottle”, this does not violate the requirements of Article 123(2) \nEPC. Amended claim II.2 still references a bottle in the second part of this claim \nwith reference to its headspace. \n"}
{"Question20": "", "Choix1": " One valid argument as to why D11 is not the closest prior art is that D11 does not require the addition of gas. \n", "Answer1": "TRUE: A valid argument as to why D11 is not the closest prior art, is that it works ac-\ncording to a different principle (extraction of air) contrary to the invention (addition \nof gas). \n", "Choix2": " If D12 is selected as the closest prior art, a possible objective technical problem can be formulated as how to preserve an alcoholic beverage by injecting an inert \ngas directly into the headspace of the bottle. \n", "Answer2": "FALSE: An inert gas being injected directly into the headspace of the bottle is the solu-\ntion in order to preserve the alcoholic beverage. The solution must not be used for \nthe formulation of the objective technical problem (Guidelines G-VII, 5.2). \n", "Choix3": " One valid argument as to why D13 is not the closest prior art is that D13 deals only with the preservation of fish oil. \n", "Answer3": "FALSE: D13 does not only relate to preserving of fish oil, but also to “beer”, see para-\ngraph [003] of D13. \n", "Choix4": " Assuming that D13 is considered to be the closest prior art, an objective technical problem to be solved may be regarded as how to reduce the amount of gas re-\nquired to remove air from above the wine level. \n"}
