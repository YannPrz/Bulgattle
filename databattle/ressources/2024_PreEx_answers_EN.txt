Question 1 
Zlatko has filed a European patent application EP-Z in Croatian as a first filing with the 
European Patent Office on 16 March 2023. EP-Z does not contain any claims. 
1.1 The period for paying the filing fee for EP-Z ended on 17 April 2023. 
TRUE – filing fee has to be paid within one month from filing (R. 38(1) EPC; 16 April 2023 
is Sunday, hence R. 134(1) EPC extended to Monday 17 April 2023) 
1.2 The period for filing an international patent application validly claiming priority from 
EP-Z ends on 16 March 2024. 
FALSE – 12 months, 16 March 2024, Saturday, extended to next working day,  
18 March 2024 (R. 134(1) EPC; Art. 87(1) EPC) 
1.3 The period for filing a translation of EP-Z into one of the official languages of the 
EPO ended on 16 May 2023. 
TRUE – translation shall be filed within two months from filing (Art. 14(2) and R. 6(1) EPC, 
GL A-VII,1.1); if the translation is not filed in accordance with the period defined by Art. 
14(2) and R. 6(1) EPC, there exists also a possibility to remedy a deficiency of filing the 
translation within the period, R. 57(a) and 58 EPC, GL A-VII 1.4; this period to remedy the 
deficiency is not the period for filing the translation; 
1.4 The period for filing claims for EP-Z ended on 16 May 2023. 
FALSE – claims are to be filed within two months from invitation (R. 58 and R. 57(c) EPC). 



Question 2 
Daniel Automotive SE filed a European patent application EP-D in June 2020. Claus is 
designated as the sole inventor. Last week, Daniel Automotive SE received a 
communication under Rule 71(3) EPC for EP-D. On 15 March 2024, an error is noted: the 
inventors of EP-D are actually Claus and Sabrina. Daniel Automotive SE now consults you 
for advice. 
A valid element of your advice for correcting the error before the EPO is that ... 
2.1 ... the applicant need not provide evidence that an error was made. 
TRUE – see R21(1) EPC, GL A-III, 5.5 no requirement to provide evidence in the EPC for 
the information provided according to R19 and R21(1) EPC 
2.2 … if the request is filed by Daniel Automotive SE, the consent of Claus is required 
to rectify the designation of the inventor. 
FALSE – see R21(1) EPC, GL A-III, 5.3 and 5.5: signature of applicant is sufficient for the 
rectification of the designation of the inventor 
2.3 ... the designation of the inventor may be corrected after EP-D has been granted. 
TRUE – GL A-III,5.5: rectification may also be requested after the proceedings before the 
EPO are terminated. 
2.4 ... Sabrina may file an opposition based on the ground of not being mentioned as 
inventor. 
FALSE – Article 100 EPC does not provide such ground for filing an opposition. 



Question 3 
Anna-Frieda filed a German national patent application DE-AF in German on 23 May 2022 
disclosing a first invention AF1 and a second invention AF2. On 24 April 2023, Anna-
Frieda filed a first European patent application EP-AF1 covering the invention AF1 only 
and claiming priority from DE-AF. On the same day, 24 April 2023, she also filed a second 
European patent application EP-AF2 covering the invention AF2 only and without claiming 
any priority. Afterwards, Anna-Frieda noticed that no drawings had been filed for EP-AF1 
and that the wrong claims had been erroneously filed for EP-AF2. On 2 May 2023, Anna-
Frieda filed the missing drawings for EP-AF1, together with a certified copy of DE-AF, a 
letter correctly stating that the missing drawings are identical to those of DE-AF and a 
request to maintain the filing date of 24 April 2023. On 2 May 2023, Anna-Frieda submitted 
the correct claims for EP-AF2.  
3.1 The filing date of EP-AF1 will be re-dated to 2 May 2023. 
FALSE – Since the missing drawings are completely contained in the priority document, 
DE-AF, and were filed within two months of the date of filing, the date of filing shall remain 
the original date of filing (R. 56(2) and (3) EPC) 
3.2 The filing date of EP-AF2 will be re-dated to 2 May 2023. 
TRUE – Since the correct claims were filed within two months of the date of filing, the 
application shall be re-dated to the date on which the correct application documents were 
filed (R. 56a(3) EPC). EP-AF2 does not claim priority to DE-AF and therefore R. 56a(4) 
EPC does not apply. 
3.3 On 15 March 2024, Anna-Frieda can file a third EP patent application EP-AF3 
validly claiming priority from EP-AF2 regarding the invention AF2. 
FALSE – EP-AF2 not the first filing of AF2 (see DE-AF) so the priority is invalid, 
Article 87(1) EPC 
3.4 The period for making the declaration of priority from DE-AF for EP-AF2 ends on 
26 August 2024. 
FALSE – If a second application is filed without claiming priority but within 12 months from 
the first application, a declaration of priority can be made within 16 months from the 
earliest priority date claimed (R. 52(2) EPC). Consider: 23 May 2022 + 16 months -> 
Saturday, 23 September 2023 (Rule 134(1) EPC)-> Monday 25 September 2023 



Question 4 
Manuela filed international application PCT-M in September 2021 without claiming priority. 
PCT-M was searched by the EPO as International Searching Authority in February 2022. 
The International Searching Authority raised non-unity objections with respect to the 
subject-matter of the claims, considering claims 20 to 35 to relate to a separate invention 
with respect to claims 1 to 19. Manuela did not pay any additional fees. The International 
Searching Authority issued a partial search report covering claims 1 to 19. PCT-M entered 
the European phase on 15 March 2024 and is referred to in the following as Euro-PCT-M. 
No amendments have been filed. 
4.1 Manuela will have an opportunity to amend the claims of Euro-PCT-M before 
substantive examination of Euro-PCT-M begins. 
TRUE – The EPO has acted as the International Searching Authority. The EPO will invite 
the applicant to amend the description and claims in accordance with Rule 161(1) EPC 
soon after Euro-PCT-M enters the European phase. Any amendment or comment can be 
filed within six months of that communication. Substantive examination only starts after the 
expiry of the Rule 161 period, or if the remainder of the Rule 161 period is waived. 
4.2 If in the application documents which are to serve as the basis of the substantive 
examination of Euro-PCT-M an invention is claimed that was not searched by the EPO as 
the International Searching Authority, Manuela will be invited to pay a further search fee in 
respect of this invention. 
TRUE – The applicant will be invited to pay further search fees in respect of inventions that 
were not searched by the EPO in the international phase (Rule 164(2)(a) EPC) 
4.3 If Manuela does not pay claims fees by expiry of the period set by Rule  161 EPC, 
Euro-PCT-M will be deemed to be withdrawn. 
FALSE – The present set of claims includes at present 35 claims, and therefore claims 
fees are due in accordance with Rule 162(1) EPC: however, the legal consequence of not 
paying claims fees for some claims is that these claims shall be deemed to be abandoned 
(Rule 162 (4) EPC) – and anyway, this is not the deadline for paying claims fees. 
4.4 
If Manuela does not comment by 15 March 2024 on the written opinion of the 
International Searching Authority, Euro-PCT-M will be deemed to be withdrawn. 
FALSE – The application is not deemed to be withdrawn, if the applicant fails to comment 
by 15 March 2024, since the applicant may do so within the period set in accordance with 
Rule 161(1) EPC. 



Question 5 
Your client Pencilz has noticed that its biggest competitor Rulerz has a granted patent EP-
R which covers important subject-matter for Pencilz. The mention of the grant of EP-R was 
published in the European Patent Bulletin on 4 August 2023. Pencilz asked you to file an 
opposition against EP-R and the notice of opposition was filed on 15 February 2024. No 
opposition fee was paid. EP-R was opposed on the following grounds: added 
subject-matter and lack of novelty. You also noticed some clarity issues with the granted 
claims of EP-R, which you also included in the statement of grounds filed with the notice of 
opposition.  
5.1 On 15 March 2024, the opposition fee may still be paid. 
TRUE – the deadline for filing an opposition is 9 months of the publication of the mention 
of the grant, i.e. 4 May 2024 (Article 99 EPC) which is a Saturday, extended to Monday, 6 
May 2024.  The opposition fee can still be paid within the opposition term (R. 77(1) EPC)
5.2 Lack of clarity is a ground for opposition. 
FALSE – lack of clarity is not a ground for opposition (Article 100 EPC). 
5.3 The Opposition Division may, of its own motion, examine EP-R for sufficiency of 
disclosure. 
TRUE – The Opposition Division may consider other grounds of opposition which have not 
been invoked by the opponent of its own motion (R. 81(1) EPC). 
5.4 A third-party that has filed observations with the EPO concerning the patentability 
of EP-R is party to the opposition proceedings. 
FALSE – explicit in Article 115 EPC, last sentence. 



Question 6 
A European patent application is refused without holding oral proceedings for lack of 
novelty in a decision dated 1 February 2024. A request for oral proceedings filed by the 
applicant at an early stage in the examination procedure has been overlooked by the 
Examining Division. The applicant files an appeal with arguments explaining why the 
subject-matter claimed is novel over the prior art.  
6.1 If the Examining Division considers the appeal to be admissible and well-founded, 
it shall rectify its decision. 
TRUE – explicit in Article 109(1) EPC. 
6.2 The appeal fee is to be reimbursed in full because the applicant's request for oral 
proceedings has been overlooked. 
TRUE – Overlooking a request for oral proceedings (Article 116(1) EPC) is a substantial 
procedural violation (Article 113(1) EPC, GL E-XII, 7.3). Therefore the appeal fee shall be 
reimbursed in full (R. 103(1)(a) EPC). 
6.3 If the notice of appeal does not contain the address of the appellant, and the 
address of the appellant is not given by today, 15 March 2024, the appeal will be rejected 
as inadmissible. 
FALSE – The Board of Appeal will communicate the fact that the address is missing to the 
appellant and shall invite him to remedy the deficiencies noted within a period to be 
specified (R. 99(1)(a) EPC and R. 101(2) EPC). 
6.4 The statement setting out the grounds of appeal has to be filed within two months 
of filing the notice of appeal. 
FALSE – the statement setting out the grounds of appeal shall be filed within four months 
of notification of the decision (Article 108 EPC). 



Question 7 
On 1 June 2021, Matthieu filed a European patent application EP-M1 disclosing and 
claiming a fork made of copper or zinc. No other materials are mentioned and the kind of 
handle is not specified. On 1 June 2022, Matthieu filed a European patent application EP-
M2 claiming priority from EP-M1 and disclosing and claiming a fork made of metal. The 
description of EP-M2 mentions that the metal can be copper, zinc, iron or any alloy of 
these metals. Claim 1 of EP-M2 claims a fork made of metal, claim 2 of EP-M2 claims a 
fork made of metal with a hollow handle. EP-M1 was published on 1 December 2022 as 
EP-M1-A1. A company brochure PA-1 published on 5 October 2021 discloses a fork made 
of copper with a hollow handle.  
7.1 PA-1 forms part of the state of the art against EP-M2 under Article 54(3) EPC. 
FALSE – PA-1 is not prior art under Article 54(3) EPC because it is a not a European 
patent application, see Article 54(3) EPC. 
7.2 EP-M1-A1 forms part of the state of the art against the subject-matter of claim 1 of 
EP-M2 under Article 54(3) EPC.  
TRUE and FALSE are accepted as correct answers – G1/15 GL F-VI, 1.5; claim 1 is 
only partially entitled to priority, i.e. for the part disclosed by EP-M1; for this disclosed part 
EP-M1-A1 does not form part of the state of the art according to Article 54(3) EPC (Article 
89 EPC); EP-M1-A1 is not prior art according to Article 54(3) EPC for the subject-matter of 
claim 1 in its entirety; 
7.3 PA-1 is novelty-destroying for the subject-matter of claim 1 of EP-M2 under 
Article 54(2) EPC.  
FALSE – G1/15, GL F-VI, 1.5 claim 1 enjoys partial priority in respect of copper and zinc, 
PA-1 is not prior art since it was published after EP-M2 filing date. 
7.4 PA-1 is novelty-destroying for the subject-matter of claim 2 of EP-M2 under 
Article 54(2) EPC. 
TRUE – claim 2 does not enjoy the priority of EP-M1, and PA-1 discloses a fork made of 
copper with a hollow handle; copper is a metal. Therefore, PA-1 discloses the subject-
matter of claim 2 of EP-M2. 



Question 8 
On 28 February 2024, Martha, a Polish national resident in Poland, filed with the EPO a 
reasoned notice of opposition against European patent EP-E in Polish. The mention of the 
grant of EP-E was published in the European Patent Bulletin on 16 June 2023. The 
language of the proceedings in the case of EP-E is English. In the notice of opposition, 
Martha requested oral proceedings. 
8.1 Martha is not entitled to a reduction of the opposition fee. 
TRUE – Under the EPC, opponents are not entitled to a reduction of the opposition fee, 
see Rule 6(3) and (4) EPC. 
8.2 Martha must file the translation of the notice of opposition at the latest on 18 
March 2024. 
FALSE – Natural persons having their residence within a Contracting State having a 
language other than English, French or German as an official language (such as Martha), 
may file documents which have to be filed within a time limit (in this case a notice of 
opposition) in an official language of that State (in this case Polish) (Article 14(4) EPC). A 
translation must be filed within one month of filing the notice of opposition, Rule 6(2) EPC, 
that is on 28 March 2024 [28 February 2024 + 1 month (Rule 131(4) EPC)], or by the end 
of the opposition period (16 March 2024 [16 June 2023 + 9 months = Saturday 16 March 
2024 -> Monday 18 March 2024), whichever is later (R. 6(2) EPC) 
8.3 If Martha requested in the notice of opposition to speak and listen in German 
during oral proceedings, the EPO would provide for interpretation. 
TRUE – Any party to oral proceedings before the EPO may use one of the other official 
languages of the EPO, on condition that such party gives notice to the EPO at least one 
month before the date laid down for such oral proceedings (Rule 4(1) EPC, first sentence). 
The European Patent Office shall, if necessary, provide at its own expense interpretation 
into the language of the proceedings, or, where appropriate, into its other official 
languages, unless such interpretation is the responsibility of one of the parties (R. 4(5) 
EPC). Alternatively, the party may make provision for interpreting into the language of the 
proceedings, English (Rule 4(1) EPC, second-to-last sentence). 
8.4  
Martha will be allowed to speak Polish during oral proceedings if she provides for 
interpretation into English. 
TRUE – any party may use an official language of a Contracting State, if the party provides 
for interpretation into the language of the proceedings (Rule 4(1) EPC, second-to-last 
sentence). 



Question 9 
Sara, an Italian citizen living in Italy, filed an international application PCT-S1 in French 
with the EPO on 20 September 2021 without claiming priority. PCT-S1 documents as filed 
are: PCT request form designating all PCT contracting states, description, claims, 
drawings and abstract. After filing, Sara noticed that her name was misspelt on the PCT 
request form, but she could still be identified. 
9.1 20 September 2021 is the international filing date of PCT-S1. 
TRUE – Article 11(1)(iii)(c) and Rule 20(1)(b) PCT. 
The receiving Office shall accord as the international filing date the date of receipt of the 
international application, provided that that Office has found that, at the time of receipt, the 
international application contains the name of the applicant indicated in a way which allows 
the identity of the applicant to be established, even if the name is misspelled. 
9.2 Without resorting to a legal remedy, the acts for entry into the EP regional phase 
shall be performed at the latest on 20 March 2024. 
FALSE – Art. 153, Rule 159 EPC: In respect of an international application for which the 
EPO is a designated or elected Office, the applicant shall perform the acts for entry into 
the European phase within thirty-one months from the date of filing of the application. 
Filing date: 20/09/2021 + 31m [R. 159(1) EPC, Rule 131(4) EPC] => Saturday 20/04/2024 
=> R. 134(1) EPC extended to Monday 22 April 2024 
9.3 
An extension of the time limit for performing the requirements for entry into the EP 
regional phase can be validly requested on 20 February 2024. 
FALSE – Rule 132(2) EPC refers to periods specified by the European Patent Office, 
which may be extended upon request, if done so before the expiry of such periods. The 31 
months period defined in Rule 159 is a fixed period specified by the EPC, which may not 
be extended. 
9.4 Further processing for performing the requirements for entry into the EP regional 
phase can be validly requested on 19 June 2024. 
TRUE – The Applicant may request further processing of the European patent application 
(Art. 121(1) EPC) with reference to the EP regional phase entry. The further processing 
shall be requested within 2 months from the notification of Communication of Loss of 
Rights under R. 112 (1) EPC (Rule 135(1) EPC). Such Communication will be sent to the 
Applicant after the expiration of the 31 months period of Rule 159 EPC, that is after 22 
April 2024. Therefore, on 19 June 2024, the two months period for replying to the 
Communication of course is still running, and it will be possible to validly requesting further 
processing for performing the requirements for the entry into the EP regional phase (Art. 
121(1), (2) EPC). 



Question 10 
Wolfgang intends to file the following patent applications: 
(1) a European patent application EP-W; 
(2) an international patent application PCT-WC. 
PCT-WC will be jointly filed in the name of Wolfgang and Christina. 
Christina lives in Berlin; Wolfgang lives in Uruguay and is of Uruguayan nationality. 
Uruguay is not a PCT member state. 
10.1 Wolfgang may validly file EP-W with the EPO. 
TRUE – There are no nationality or residence restrictions for filing a European patent 
application with the EPO, Article 58 EPC. 
10.2 PCT-WC may be validly filed with the EPO as receiving Office. 
TRUE – The EPO is the receiving Office competent for applicant Christina, who has her 
residence within one of the Contracting States (Germany), Article 151 EPC, Rule 157(1) 
EPC and Rule 19.1(a) PCT. If there are two (or more) applicants, the requirements of Rule 
19.1 PCT regarding where to file are satisfied if the international application is filed with the 
competent receiving office of at least one of the applicants, Rule 19.2(i) PCT. 
10.3 PCT-WC can be validly filed with the International Bureau as receiving Office. 
TRUE – A PCT application can be validly filed before the International Bureau (IB) 
whatever the nationality or residence of the applicant, Rule 19.1(iii) and Rule 19.2 (ii) PCT. 
10.4  If Wolfgang moves to Berlin two months after validly filing PCT-WC, the 
International Bureau will, upon request, record the change of residence in relation to  
PCT-WC. 
TRUE – Only the IB can record the residence change upon the applicant’s request, Rule 
92bis.1.(a) (i)PCT. 



Question 11  
11.1 The electronic cigarette of the first embodiment of the application is covered by the 
scope of claim I.1. 
TRUE – see paragraph [006] disclosing an electronic cigarette (100) comprising a liquid 
container (130, an atomiser (120) in connection with the liquid container (130), a short-
range communication component (170) and a controller (140). Vapour production is 
activated (push button in paragraph [006]). The scope of claim I.1 is formulated with an 
“or” clause that broadens such scope to cover either of the alternatives. 
11.2 The electronic cigarette of the second embodiment of the application is covered by 
the scope of claim I.2. 
FALSE – The second embodiment of the application covers only the use of fingerprints 
(paragraph [008]), not the use of scheduling. 
11.3 The electronic cigarette of the third embodiment of the application is covered by the 
scope of claim I.1. 
TRUE – Vapour production can be activated with a pushbutton or a pressure sensor in the 
third embodiment (paragraph [009]) as a particular form of activation, covered by the 
scope of claim I.1. 
11.4 The electronic cigarette of the fourth embodiment of the application is covered by 
the scope of claim I.2. 
FALSE – The fourth embodiment is the combination of the second embodiment (no 
scheduling, paragraph [008]) with the third one. The second embodiment of the application 
covers only the use of fingerprints (paragraph [008]), not the use of scheduling. 



Question 12 
12.1 The electronic cigarette in D1 reads information that can prevent the unauthorised 
use of disposable cartridges. 
TRUE – Such information is read by the short-range communication component 12 in D1, 
paragraph [004], which can prevent two cases of unauthorized use of disposable 
cartridges, refilled cartridges or cartridges with non-authorized identifiers 
12.2 The subject-matter of claim I.1 is novel with respect to D1. 
FALSE – D1 discloses an electronic cigarette (“electronic cigarette”, paragraph [002]) 
comprising a liquid container (“disposable cartridge 20”, paragraph [002]), an atomiser 
(“controller 15 connected to … an atomiser”, paragraph [002]) in connection with the liquid 
container , communication component (“communication component 12”, paragraph [002]), 
and a controller (“controller 15”, paragraph [002]) for activating vapour production of the 
electronic cigarette (“Upon authenticating the identifier 23, the controller 15 sends a signal 
to the atomiser to enable vapour production”, paragraph [004]). 
12.3 The subject-matter of claim I.2 is novel with respect to D1. 
TRUE – D1 does not disclose scheduling. 
12.4 D1 discloses an electronic cigarette that provides a liquid solution to avoid the 
health risks caused by high nicotine concentrations. 
TRUE – Paragraph [002] of D1 discloses an electronic cigarette provided with such 
components of liquid solutions, directed to comply with health regulations in paragraph 
[003].  



Question 13 
13.1 D2 discloses a mobile app to detect health risks caused by the mixture of 
components for a liquid solution for electronic cigarettes. 
FALSE – D2 does not refer to any health risk. 
13.2 The range of nicotine values ranging from 0 mg/ml to 20 mg/ml disclosed in 
paragraph [013] of the application is novel over D2. 
FALSE – D2 discloses a range of 5-7 mg/ml between the end points (0-20 mg/ml in 
paragraph [013] of the application), therefore this range is not novel (Guidelines G-VI, 8). 
13.3 D2 discloses an electronic cigarette with a communication component configured to 
read information from an RFID tag to validate a liquid container. 
FALSE – D2 does not disclose reading information with a communication component from 
an RFID tag, but from a printed label. 
13.4  D2 discloses a liquid solution that comprises further chemical substances in 
addition to flavouring. 
TRUE – D2 discloses further chemical substances (“chemical substances like nicotine, 
propylene glycol, vegetable glycerine and banana flavouring”) which are combined with 
banana flavouring (paragraph [004]), in particular with a recipe with 5-7 mg/ml. 



Question 14 
14.1  Claim II.1 meets the requirements of Article 123(2) EPC. 
TRUE – basis in paragraph [006] 
14.2  Claim II.2 meets the requirements of Article 123(2) EPC. 
FALSE – The fingerprint sensor is an alternative to the push button (paragraph [008]). In 
addition, claim II.2 lacks the features disclosed in combination with the fingerprint 
sensor 210 in paragraph [008]. 
14.3  Claim II.3 meets the requirements of Article 123(2) EPC. 
FALSE – The application as filed does not directly and unambiguously disclose that the 
short-range communication signal allows the activation of vapour production, for instance 
without a controller. Paragraph [007] discloses that the controller allows or prevents the 
activation of vapour production. 
14.4  Claim II.4 meets the requirements of Article 123(2) EPC. 
FALSE – Claim II.4. lacks the features disclosed in combination with the pressure sensor 
and it is broader than the disclosure of paragraph [009]: that the pressure difference is 
created by the user inhaling though the mouthpiece (110). 



Question 15 
15.1 The subject-matter of claim III.1 is novel over D1. 
FALSE – D1 see paragraph [004], in which the controller prevents vapour production if the 
identifier of the RFID tag is deemed invalid after reading. 
15.2 The subject-matter of claim III.2 is novel over D1. 
TRUE – no disclosure in the prior art about an electronic cigarette that delivers 
therapeutical drugs as part of the smoking experience. 
15.3 The subject-matter of claim III.2 is excluded from patentability. 
FALSE – devices delivering therapy do not fall under the exception to patentability 
pursuant to Article 53 (c) EPC concerning methods for therapy, that does not extend to 
products. 
15.4 The subject-matter of claim III.3 involves an inventive step in view of the disclosure of 
D1 as the closest prior art and D2. 
TRUE – D1 would be chosen as closest prior art, in view that it discloses all of the features 
of the claim including electronic verification of the liquid container apart from detecting a 
pressure difference when inhaling. The French version of claim III.3 using “courte durée” 
instead of “courte portée” does not impact the answer. 
The effect of this differentiating feature is to allow the activation of the vapour production of 
the electronic cigarette in a convenient way to the user. 
D1 does not disclose any detection of pressure differences to allow the activation the 
vapour production. Therefore, D1 neither discloses nor hints towards the solution claimed. 
D2 is not concerned with detecting pressure differences or allowing the activation of 
vapour production with an electrical power supply. The person skilled in the art would not 
use D2 to achieve the effect sought. Therefore, it also involves an inventive step over D1 
even if combined with D2. 



Question 16 
16.1  The usage of Product X as an antifungal is sufficiently disclosed by the application 
as filed. 
FALSE – there is no disclosure in the application of any effect of Product X as antifungal 
(or antiparasitic). According to the description (paragraph [08]) the skilled person would 
require a research program based on trial and error to achieve such effects, which is 
indicative of lack of sufficient disclosure (GL F-III.3). 
16.2  The subject-matter of claim I.1 is sufficiently disclosed by the application as filed.  
FALSE – there is no disclosure in the application of any effect as antifungal or 
antiparasitic. According to the description (paragraph [08]) the skilled person would require 
a research program based on trial and error to achieve such effects, which is indicative of 
lack of sufficient disclosure (GL F-III.3). The claim is not sufficiently disclosed over the 
“whole area claimed”, GL F-III.1. 
16.3  The usage of Product X as an antibiotic is sufficiently disclosed by the application 
as filed.  
TRUE – see table 1 and paragraph [01], [07] and [09] and [10], disclosing experimental 
data supporting the antibiotic effect of the use of product X. 
16.4  The EPO will issue a communication according to Rule 63 EPC because the claim 
set comprises a plurality of independent claims of the same category. 
FALSE – The EPO would issue a Rule 62a EPC communication in such case. 



Question 17 
17.1  Claim I.9 is excluded from patentability because it relates to a method which 
encompasses at least one therapeutic step. 
TRUE – Article 53(c) EPC and GL G-II, 4.2.1.2 
17.2  Claim I.3 is limited to the treatment of rhinoviruses, influenza viruses and 
coronaviruses by Product X. 
FALSE – said claim is only limited to the treatment as an antiviral, the types of viruses are 
only optional because the term “more particular” is used, GL F-IV, 4.9. 
17.3  There is a basis in the application as filed, so that claim I.5 can be amended 
compliant to Article 123(2) EPC in a way that the resulting subject-matter also covers 
administering Product X for seven days. 
TRUE – The description on paragraph [12] provides basis to amend the claim compliant to 
Article 123(2) EPC to a range of at least 3 days. Such an amended claim covers also 
applying Product X for 7 days. 
 17.4  The subject-matter of claim I.4 is unclear because the essential feature of 
administration via nasal spray is missing.  
FALSE –The effect of the invention is reached without a nasal spray, see table 1 and 
paragraph [12], GL F-IV.4.5.2. The administration as a nasal spray improves the effect, 
see table 1 and paragraph [13] of the application and is declared as being not essential. 



Question 18 
18.1  The subject-matter of claim I.1 is not novel over D1. 
FALSE – None of the prior art documents discloses the usage of Product X as an antiviral, 
an antibiotic, an antifungal or an antiparasitic, second medical use – Article 54(5) EPC, GL 
G-VI.7.1). 
18.2  The subject-matter of claim I.5 is not novel over D1. 
TRUE – because claim I.5 does not refer to a second medical use, Article 54(5) EPC does 
not apply. GL G-VI, 6.1.2. In addition, D1 explicitly discloses  endpoint of 50 mg/kg 
bodyweight per day and endpoint of 6 months of overlapping ranges, GL G-VI, 8(iii). 
18.3  The subject-matter of claim I.7 is not novel over D2. 
TRUE and FALSE are accepted as correct answers – Category of claim I.7 might be 
interpreted as being unclear because dependent claims I.7 does not repeat “product X for 
use …”, see GL G-VI, 7.1.5. If claim I.7 is interpreted as being directed to the product per 
se, the term “is administered as nasal spray” could be interpreted as not limiting the 
product X which is disclosed by D2. If claim I.7 is interpreted as a second medical use 
claim, the steps of administration as nasal spray would be limiting and, thus, novel over 
D2. Since the answer depends on the above interpretation, points are awarded for both 
answers. 
18.4  The subject-matter of claim I.1 is not novel over D3. 
TRUE – D3 discloses antibiotic treatment of product X referring to the Lyme disease, 
which is a bacterial infection, as made explicit in D3.  



Question 19 
19.1  The subject-matter of claim I.1 involves an inventive step over D3 alone. 
FALSE – D3 discloses that Product X has an antibiotic effect and, thus, the subject-matter 
of claim I.1 is even not novel over D3. 
19.2  For the following statement, assume that D1 is regarded as the closest prior art to 
the subject-matter of claim I.3: A valid argument that the subject-matter of claim I.3 
involves an inventive step over D1 is that there is no hint in any one of documents D1, D2 
and D3 that Product X has an antiviral effect. 
TRUE and FALSE are accepted as correct answers – Category of claim I.3 might be 
interpreted as being unclear because dependent claims I.3 does not repeat “product X for 
use …”, see GL G-VI, 7.1.5. If claim I.3, despite the reference to “the treatment” is 
interpreted as being directed to the product per se, the term “wherein the treatment is 
antiviral, more particularly a treatment against rhinovirus, influenza virus or coronavirus” 
could be interpreted as not limiting the product X, the subject-matter of claim I.3 would not 
be novel and, thus, not inventive over the prior art. If claim I.3 is interpreted as a second 
medical use claim (because it refers to “the treatment”, the subject-matter would be novel 
and inventive over the prior art because none of the documents D1, D2 or D3 discloses or 
hints an antiviral effect. Since the answer depends on the above interpretation, points are 
awarded for both answers. 
19.3  The subject-matter of claim I.6 is novel over D1. 
FALSE – because claims I.5 and I.6 do not refer to a second medical use, Article 54(5) 
EPC does not apply, GL G-VI, 6.1.2. 
However, TRUE and FALSE are accepted as correct answers. Category of claim I.6 
might be interpreted as being unclear because dependent claim I.6 does not define 
“product X for use …” see GL G-VI, 7.1.5. 
19.4  The difference of the subject-matter of claim I.8 over D3 as closest prior art may be 
regarded as not providing a technical effect. 
TRUE and FALSE are accepted as correct answers – Category of claim I.8 might be 
interpreted as being unclear because dependent claims I.8 does not repeat “product X for 
use …”, see GL G-VI, 7.1.5. If it is interpreted as a product claim, there is no difference 
providing a technical effect. If it is interpreted as a product claims with a medical use, the 
technical effect would be a higher suppression factor, see table 1, paragraph [13]. 



Question 20 
20.1  The subject-matter of claim II.2 complies with the requirements of Article 123(2) 
EPC. 
FALSE – Only three specific examples of RNA viruses disclosed in the application 
(paragraph [10]). Claim II.2 defines an unallowable intermediate generalization GL H-
V.3.2.1; there is no disclosure of the general group of RNA viruses. 
20.2  The subject-matter of claim II.5 complies with the requirements of Article 123(2) 
EPC. 
FALSE – The subrange of 5-30 mg/kg is not disclosed and not directly and unambiguously 
derivable from the application as filed. 
20.3  The subject-matter of claim II.10 complies with the requirements of Article 123(2) 
EPC. 
TRUE and FALSE are accepted as correct answers – For the English and French 
versions, the answer is True. Paragraph [11] provides basis to directly and unambiguously 
derive the subject-matter. For the German version, the answer depends on how the last 
sentence of paragraph [11] is interpreted. 
20.4  The effect provided by the distinguishing features of the subject-matter of claim II.10 
with respect to D3 is a synergistic effect. 
TRUE – see description [11] disclosing a synergistic effect (GL G-VII.7): “we observed a 
suppression factor for streptococcal infection (bacterial infection) that was stronger than 
the sum of the individual effects of Product X and compound Z”.
