However, the amounts to be contributed by  States in which the number of patent applications filed exceeds 25 000 shall then be taken  as a whole and a new scale drawn up in proportion to the total number of patent applications  filed in these States.


(4)  Where the scale position of any Contracting State cannot be established in accordance  with paragraph 3, the Administrative Council  shall, with the consent of that State, decide its  scale position.
