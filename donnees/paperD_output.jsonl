The examiner cited an article disclosing a composition comprising 40% of the compound E1 and published in December 2017. When analysing the technical teaching of the article, the skilled person would immediately recognise that the disclosure is erroneous and that the only possible correction would be a composition comprising 15% of the compound E1.\nIs the article novelty-destroying for the subject-matter claimed in EP-E?", "answer": "(The following possible answer applies only for the German and French versions of the question, whereas the English version should be read as if the article was published in December 2019):\nEP-E was filed within the priority period, which was extended from 30 May 2020 (Sat) through 1 June 2020\n(Whit Monday) to 2 June 2020 (Tue) and the EPO's filing offices in Germany were closed from 30 May to 1\nJune 2020,\nRule 134(1) EPC. Hence, the effective date for the composition comprising E1 in the range [10-20%] is the filing date of the priority document JP-E and the effective date for E1 being within [5-10%[ or ]20-40%] is the filing date of EP-E, G1/15. The skilled person can see at once that the disclosure of the article contains errors, i.e. a composition comprising 40% of E1, and can identify what the only possible correction should be, i.e. a composition comprising 15% of E1. Hence, the article can be considered to contain the correction when assessing its relevance to patentability, i.e. it discloses a composition comprising 15% of E1,\nGuidelines G-IV, 9.\nThe article forms prior art under Article 54(2) EPC only for the subject-matter not entitled to priority, G3/93, i.e. the composition comprising E1 in the range [5-10%[ or ]20-40%].\nTherefore the article is not novelty destroying, because it discloses an embodiment of a composition comprising 15% of E1, which falls within the range [10-20%] of E1, being entitled to the right of priority."}

The opposition division will inform the patent proprietor that the opposition proceedings are continued, Guidelines-D-VII, 5.2.\n(b) Because the opposition is still pending, the proprietor should file an amendment limiting the claims to claim 2 only, which is occasioned by the ground of opposition under Article 100a EPC, Rule 80\nEPC.

{"category": "ExamQA", "year": "2023", "question_number": "1", "question": "Question 1\nApplicant A filed a European patent application EP-A, which describes and claims\na first invention comprising two alternative solutions to a technical problem consisting of features B+C and B+D respectively, and\na second invention consisting of features E+F.\nThe first and second inventions are not linked by a single general inventive concept. Only the first invention was searched, and relevant prior art was found only for B+C. In the light of the technical problem, it is directly and unambiguously apparent that feature B is indispensable for the function of the first invention.\nApplicant A filed divisional applications DIV1 and DIV2, both based directly on EP-A. DIV1 as filed claims and describes only feature D. DIV2 as filed claims and describes only the combination B+D+F, wherein F is presented as an optional feature.\nSubsequently, the examining division issued a written decision dated 3 January 2023, refusing EP-A on the ground that a claim directed to B+C lacked novelty. Today, DIV1 and DIV2 are pending.\n(a) Can valid patents be obtained for DIV1 and DIV2 and what should be done?\n(b) Can applicant A still prosecute invention E+F and what should be done?", "answer": "(a) No valid patent can be obtained for DIV1.\nA claim without B extends beyond the content of the parent application, Guidelines H-V, 3.1,\nbecause the same principles as for assessing added subject-matter under Art. 123(2) EPC are to be applied in the assessment of Art. 76(1) EPC, G 1/05. On the other hand, B cannot be reinstated in DIV1, because it is not originally disclosed in DIV1, Art. 123(2) EPC.\nFor DIV2, a valid patent can be obtained. Parent application EP-A was pending when DIV2\nwas filed, R. 36(1) EPC. As it stands, the claim of DIV2 with feature F extends beyond the content of the parent application, Art. 76(1) EPC, because EP-A does not disclose F in combination with B+D. Hence, feature F needs to be removed from DIV2 to satisfy Art. 76(1)\nEPC. According to G 1/05, DIV2 can be amended even if EP-A was no longer pending.\nFeature F is optional. Therefore, removing feature F does not violate Art. 123(2) EPC. Since there is no relevant prior art for B+D, B+D is new and inventive, Art. 52(1), 54 and 56 EPC.\n(b) An application which has been refused by the first instance is still pending until the expiry of the period for filing an appeal, G 1/09.\nHence, EP-A is pending until 03.01.2023 + 10 days (Rule 126(2) EPC) + 2 months (Art. 108\nEPC) = 13.03.2023 (Mon).\nTo prosecute invention E+F, applicant A should thus file a divisional application claiming and describing E+F based on EP-A until 13.03.23, Rule 36(1) EPC."}
{"category": "ExamQA", "year": "2023", "question_number": "2", "question": "Question 2\nOn 5 May 2022, applicant B resident in France filed an international patent application PCT-B with the EPO as receiving Office. Applicant B intended to claim priority from the US application US-B filed by applicant B on 9 July 2021. While the priority claim in the request of PCT-B stated the correct filing date of US-B, it included a typographical error in one digit of the application number of US-B. The request contained a certified copy of US-B. The description of PCT-B includes a statement that priority is claimed from US-B indicating the correct application number of US-B. Otherwise the description, the claims and the drawings are identical to those of US-B.\nIn May 2022, applicant B received an invitation issued by the EPO as receiving Office to correct the priority claimed in the request of PCT-B. Unfortunately, applicant B overlooked this invitation and did not reply to it.\nThe EPO acting as International Searching Authority transmitted the international search\nreport to applicant B on 12 July 2022.\n(a) Is the priority claim considered to have been made for the purposes of the procedure\nunder the PCT?\n(b) What is the last day to file a demand for international preliminary examination?\n(c) Is it still possible to rectify the priority claim in the international phase?", "answer": "(a) The priority claim and the number in the priority document are inconsistent. Although the applicant failed to reply to the invitation, the priority claim is considered to have been made under the PCT, because the exceptions under Rule 26bis.2 PCT apply:\n• The deficiency relates to an inconsistency between an indication in the priority claim and the corresponding indication appearing in the priority document, Rule 26bis.2 (c)(ii)\nPCT, and\n• PCT-B was filed within the priority period of US-B, Rule 26bis.2(c)(iii) PCT, i.e. before\n09.07.2021 + 12 months =  09.07.2022 (Sat), Art. 8 PCT and Art. 4C(1) PC, extended to 11.07.2022, Rule 80.5 PCT.\n(b) The demand may be made at any time before the expiration of the later of the following periods, Rule 54bis.1(a)(i) and (ii) PCT:\n• A first period which is three months from the date of transmittal of the international search report to the applicant, i.e. 12.07.2022 + 3 months = 12.10.2022 (Wed)\n• A second period which is 22 months from the priority date, i.e. 09.07.2021 + 22 months\n= 09.05.2023 (Tue)\nHence, the demand may be made until 09.05.2023.\n(c) Yes, the mistake in the priority claim can be rectified under Rule 91.1 PCT, because it would not cause a change in the priority date, Rule 91.1(g)(iv) PCT.\nThe mistake was made in the request. Therefore B should submit a request for rectification to the EPO acting as receiving Office, Rule 91.1(b)(i) PCT and Rule 91.2 PCT.\nThe request should be submitted at the latest on 09.07.2021 + 26 months = 09.09.2023 (Sat),\nextended to 11.09.2023, Rule 80.5 PCT.\nIt shall specify the mistake to be rectified, i.e. the erroneous application number, and the proposed rectification, i.e. claiming priority from US-B with the correct application number.\nThe PCT request is part of the international application as filed, Art. 3(2) PCT. Hence the\n“applicable date” for the purposes of R. 91.1(c) PCT is the international filing date, Rule\n91.1(f)(i) PCT.\nIt is obvious that at the filing date, something else was intended than the erroneous priority application number and that nothing else could have been intended by applicant A than the correct application number of US-B, i.e. the proposed rectification, because:\n• the description of PCT-B comprises the correct priority claim,\n• the description, claims and drawings of PCT-B are otherwise identical to those of US- B, and\n• the certified copy of US-B was filed on the filing date.\nThe criteria for correction applied by the EPO acting as receiving Office specified in Rule\n91.1(c) PCT are therefore met and the priority claim will be corrected."}

The mention of the grant of EP-C was published on 8 June 2022.\nCompany D is concerned about infringing EP-C with its products sold in Germany since July 2022. Company D is preparing notice of opposition against EP-C and is confident that it will get the patent revoked.\nToday, company D consults the European Patent Register and notices that the representative of company C sent a fax to the EPO containing both a request that EP-C be revoked and an order to debit the revocation fee from its deposit account.\nCompany D also noticed that company C has not yet paid any renewal fees to the German Patent and Trade Mark Office.\n(a) What is the current status of the revocation proceedings for EP-C?\n(b) Why should company D file opposition against EP-C?", "answer": "(a) The request for revocation was validly filed by fax. However, the debiting order is not valid because it was filed by fax, ADA2022 7.1.3.\nTherefore, revocation proceedings are not pending at present, Art. 105a(1) EPC.\n(b) The period for filing an opposition expires on 08.06.22 + 9 months (Art. 99(1) EPC) = 08.03.23\n(Wed) extended to 09.03.23 (Rule 134(1) EPC) since the EPO in Berlin is closed on that day.\nA first reason for filing an opposition against EP-C is that there is no certainty that EP-C will be revoked, because revocation proceedings are not pending.\nA second reason is that the renewal fee to pay to the German Patent and Trademark Office fell due on 30.09.22, but may still be paid with surcharge until 31.03.23, National Law Table\nVI. Since Germany is a party to the London agreement, EP-C is currently in force in Germany.\nThe renewal fee with surcharge may be paid after the end of the opposition period. Hence, at the end of the opposition period, there will be no guarantee that EP-C will lapse in Germany.\nA third reason is that, irrespective of whether or not company C lets EP-C lapse by not paying the renewal fees, it is still advisable to file an opposition because a revocation or a limitation in opposition has an ex tunc effect, Art. 68 EPC. If the patent merely lapses, company D may still be sued for having infringed the patent with their products sold between July 2022 and lapse of the patent."}
{"category": "ExamQA", "year": "2023", "question_number": "4", "question": "Question 4\nEuropean patent EP-E was assigned from company E to company F.

Hence, company E was not a party to the proceedings. Therefore, company E was not entitled to file the appeal, Art. 107 EPC.\nCurrently, the appeal is thus likely to be rejected as inadmissible, Rule 101(1) EPC.\n(b) The error in the appellant's identity can be corrected under Rule 139 EPC, provided that the correction does not reflect a later change of mind as to whom the appellant should be, but on the contrary only expresses what was intended when filing the appeal (G 1/12).\nTherefore, you can improve the situation by requesting correction of the appellant's name under Rule 139 EPC as soon as possible, such that company F becomes the appellant. For that you have to provide evidence of the original intention, e.g. a copy of the email of company\nF instructing you to file an appeal.\nThe EPO will then correct the appellant's identity to be company F.\nSince company F is an adversely affected party to the proceedings, the appeal will be admissible, Art. 107 EPC."}

What procedural steps must applicant G carry out?", "answer": "(a) A PCT application shall contain an abstract, Art. 3(2) PCT. A missing abstract is a defect under\nArt. 14(1)(a)(iv) PCT. The invitation from the INPI is an invitation under Art. 14(1)(b) and Rule\n26.1 PCT.\nA time limit of two months was set under Rule 26.2 PCT, which expired on 9 February 2023\n(Thu).\nPCT-G was thus declared withdrawn by the INPI, because G filed the abstract too late, Art.\n14(1)(b) PCT.\nIf nothing is done, according to Art. 24(1)(ii) PCT, PCT-G will cease to have the effect of a regular national application in each designated state, pursuant to Art. 11(3) PCT.\n(b) The EPO acting as designated Office shall excuse the missing of the time limit for reasons admitted under the EPC, Art. 48(2)(a) PCT, namely further processing or re-establishment, Rule 82bis.2 PCT, Art. 121 and Art. 122 EPC.\nUnder the EPC, regarding the time limit of two months provided for in Rule 58 EPC in case of a missing abstract, further processing is ruled out (Rule 135(2) EPC), but re-establishment of rights is possible (Art. 122 EPC and Rule 136(3) EPC).\nAccording to Guidelines E-IX, 2.9.1 and 2.9.2, G must:\n- request the International Bureau to send copies of documents forming PCT-G to the\nEPO acting as designated Office;\n- pay the filing fee under Rule 159(1)(c) EPC;\n- request the EPO acting as designated Office to excuse the missing of the time limit, pay the fee for re-establishment (Rule 136(1) EPC) and prove all due care (Rule 136(2)\nEPC).\nThese steps have to be carried out before 06.03.2023 + 2 months (Rule 136(1) EPC) =\n06.05.2023 (Sat), extended under Rule 134(1) EPC to 08.05.2023 (Mon), because removal of the cause of non-compliance is the date of actual receipt of the communication noting a loss of rights, Guidelines E-VIII, 3.1.3."}
{"category": "ExamQA", "year": "2023", "question_number": "6", "question": "Question 6\nEuropean patent application EP-H describes a product P, a method only resulting in product P and a particular use of product P as a fertiliser to enhance plant growth.\nEP-H was granted with a single claim to product P.\nOpposition was validly filed against EP-H based on the ground of lack of novelty. The opponent cited EP-J, a document under Article 54(3) EPC that discloses the same product P, wherein P is obtained by a different method, and the use of product P as a detergent.\n(a) How should EP-H be amended to provide the maximum scope of protection? Give\nreasons why EP-H as amended meets the requirements of Articles 123 and 54 EPC.\n(b) How would your answer to (a) change if EP-H described product P for use as a medicament rather than describing the use of product P as a fertiliser?", "answer": "(a) The granted claim lacks novelty, Art. 100(a), 52(1) and 54(3) EPC. There is no basis for an amended product claim that would satisfy the requirement of novelty.\nEP-H should thus be amended as follows:\nThe granted claim should be replaced by a claim directed to the “use of product P as a fertilizer”. This claim satisfies the requirements of Art. 123(3) EPC, because it defines the use of product P for a particular purpose to achieve an effect, G2/88. Moreover, the use claim satisfies the requirements of Art. 123(2) EPC because this use is originally disclosed in EP- H. This claim is also new, Art. 54 EPC, because EP-J does not show the particular use of P as a fertilizer.\nIn addition, a claim directed to the method of producing P as disclosed in EP-H should be added. Since this method only results in product P and a product claim confers protection to all processes for making that product, this claim does not extend the protection conferred thereby, Art. 123(3) EPC and Guidelines H-V, 7.2. Moreover, as this method claim is originally disclosed in EP-H, it fulfils the requirement of Art. 123(2) EPC. Since EP-J discloses a different method, the method claim is new (Art. 54 EPC).\n(b) The amended claim to the use of product P will have to be re-formulated to a purpose-related product claim, i.e. “product P for use as a medicament.” The reason is that a claim relating to\n“the use of product P as a medicament” is excluded from patentability as it relates to a method for treatment of the human or animal body by therapy, Art. 53(c) EPC. Such a claim does not extend the conferred protection (Art 123(3) EPC), because the scope of protection of purpose-related product claims is limited to the substance or composition in the context of its medical use, Guidelines G-VI, 7.1. Since the medical use of product P is not known from the prior art, such a claim satisfies the requirement of novelty under Art. 54(4) EPC."}

The PCT request indicates the EPO\nas International Searching Authority (ISA). The filing fee, search fee and transmittal fee have\nbeen duly paid.\nIn a notification dated 17 January 2024, the SPTO invited applicant D to furnish a translation.\n(a) In which language was PCT-3 filed and what steps does applicant D have to take for the ISA to start the search?\n(b) Applicant D wants to file amended claims and correct an obvious mistake in the description at the lowest possible cost during the international phase. In what language, when\nand where do the respective documents have to be filed?", "answer": "(a) The SPTO accepts only Spanish as the language in which international applications may be filed, Rule 12.1(a) PCT and PCT Applicant’s Guide Annex C. PCT-3 was filed in Spanish, because otherwise the SPTO would have transmitted it to the IB, Rule 19.4(a)(ii) and Rule\n19.4(b) PCT.\nThe EPO, acting as ISA, Article 152 EPC, accepts English, French or German, PCT-EPO\nGuidelines A-VII, 2.1. Therefore, Spanish is not accepted. The invitation issued by the SPTO is thus an invitation under Rule 12.3(c) PCT to furnish a translation into one of English, French or German for the international search. The time limit for the late filing of the translation is the later of:\n- one month from the date of the invitation, i.e. 17 January 2024 + 1 month → 17 February\n2024 (Sat) → 19 February 2024 (Mon), Rule 80.5 PCT, and\n- two months from the date of receipt of the international application by the receiving Office, i.e. 05.03.2024 (Tue, today). Therefore, today, D needs to file the translation and pay the late furnishing fee, Rule 12.3(e) PCT.\n(b) According to Article 19(1) PCT, amended claims can only be filed after the receipt of the international search report and, according to Rule 46.1 PCT, within 2 months from the date of its transmittal or within 16 months from the priority date, whichever expires later. The amendments must be filed at the IB, Rule 46.2 PCT.\nSince the application is filed in Spanish, it will be published in Spanish, which is a language of publication, Rule 48.3(a) PCT. Hence, the amendments must be filed in Spanish, Rule 46.3\nPCT.\nAn obvious mistake in the description can be corrected under Rule 91.1(b)(ii) PCT. Since the application is translated under Rule 12.3(a) PCT, the rectified description needs to be filed both in Spanish and in the language of translation, Rule 12.2(b)(i) PCT. This must be done at the EPO/ISA within 26 months from the priority date, Rule 91.2 PCT."}

Since the search opinion was negative, a reply to the opinion also had to be filed by the same date, Rule 70a(1) EPC.\nThe communication noting the loss of rights is a communication under Rule 112(1) EPC indicating  that  the  application  is  deemed  to  be  withdrawn  because  three  independent procedural acts were omitted:\n- payment of the examination fee, Article 94(1) and (2) EPC;\n- payment of the designation fee, Rule 39(2) EPC;\n- non-compliance with the invitation to comment on the objections raised and/or to correct any deficiencies noted in the search opinion, Rule 70a(3) EPC.\nFurther processing, Article 121 and Rule 135(1) EPC, was available for each of the omitted acts until 12 December 2023 + 2 months → 12 February 2024 (Mon). Thus, today, it is too late.\nRemoval of the cause of non-compliance is today, i.e. when company C became aware of the notification. Re-establishment into the period for further processing under Article 122(1) EPC is thus still possible until 05 March 2024 + 2 months → 05 May 2024 (Sun) → 06 May 2024\n(Mon), Rule 131(4) and Rule 134(1) EPC.

Consequently, three requests for re-establishment must be filed and three fees for re-establishment must be paid, Guidelines E-VIII, 3.1.3.\nCompany C must provide evidence that the failure to observe the time limit resulted from an isolated mistake within a normally satisfactory monitoring system, Guidelines E-VIII, 3.2,\nwhich shows that all due care was taken, Rule 136(2) EPC.\nCompany C must further complete the omitted acts for re-establishment, i.e. request further processing, Article 121(1) EPC and Rule 135(1) EPC, by:\n- Paying the examination fee, and paying the fee for further processing, i.e. paying the examination fee with a 50% surcharge, Article 2(1) item 12 RFees;\n- Paying the designation fee, and paying the fee for further processing, i.e. paying the designation fee with a 50% surcharge, Article 2(1) item 12 RFees;\n- Filing a reply to the search opinion and paying the fee for further processing, Article 2(1)\nitem 12 RFees.\nThe renewal fee for the third year was due on 30.11.2023, Rule 51(1) EPC.

It includes the opponents' particulars, correctly identifies the opposed patent EP-1 and contains a statement of the extent to which EP-1 is opposed and properly substantiated grounds for this.\nOn 29 January 2024, the opposition division issued an invitation to remedy deficiencies, setting a time limit of two months.\nYesterday B filed a translation of the notice of opposition in English.\nWhat procedural steps need to be taken to remedy the deficiencies and for substantive examination of the joint opposition to start?", "answer": "The signature of A is invalid, because, in a joint opposition, each party or their duly authorized representative must sign the notice of opposition giving rise to their participation, Guidelines A-VIII, 1.4.\nSince A is not resident in a contracting state, A must appoint a professional representative for filing the opposition, Article 133(2) EPC. The invitation of the opposition division is an invitation under Rule 77(2) EPC to appoint a representative and to arrange for the signature or approval of the notice of opposition by the representative to be appointed, Guidelines D-IV,\n1.2.2.2 (iv).

The professional representative appointed by A shall be deemed to be the common representative upon appointment, Rule 151(1) EPC.\nBoth A and B are persons according to Article 14(4) EPC, because both are nationals of Spain and additionally B is resident of Spain, which has Spanish as an official language. Hence, the joint opponents could file the notice of opposition in Spanish, but a translation in an official language of the EPO had to be filed. The translation could be filed until the expiration of the opposition period, i.e. until yesterday, Rule 6(2) EPC. The translation was therefore filed on time.\nHowever,  since  the  letter  accompanying  the  translation  was  not  filed  by  the  common representative, it will be considered not duly signed, Rule 50(3) EPC in combination with\nRule 86 EPC. The common representative, once appointed by A, will have to sign a letter accompanying the translation on invitation of the EPO within a time limit to be specified.\nOnce this is done, the translation will retain its original date, i.e. it will be considered to have been filed in due time."}

The EPO may disregard evidence, which has not been submitted by the parties in due time, Article 114(2)\nEPC.\nIn the present case:\n- EP-D2 will be admitted into the proceedings, because it is prima facie relevant to the assessment of novelty, Article 114(1) EPC, Guidelines E-VI, 2.1;\n- EP-D3 will not be admitted into the proceedings, because it is not related to the extent of the opposition, G9/91.\nClaim 1 of EP-4 lacks novelty in view of EP-D2, Article 100(a) EPC in conjunction with\nArticles 52(1) and 54(3) EPC. Therefore, company E should as soon as possible file a new\n(main) request with claims directed to subject-matters 1: A+B, 2: A+C and 3: D.\nThe  replacement  of  one  independent  claim  as  granted  by  two  independent  claims  is admissible as the replacement is occasioned by a ground for opposition, Guidelines H-II, 3.1.\nThe thus amended claims are novel over EP-D2. The patent will therefore be maintained in amended form, Article 101(3)(a) EPC.\nThe resulting patent will nevertheless not be valid. The claim directed to subject-matter D lacks novelty over EP-D3 but cannot be deleted in opposition proceedings, because it is not part of the extent of the opposition, G9/91.\nTo obtain a valid patent, company E should file a request for limitation, Article 105a(1) EPC, after the opposition proceedings are terminated, Article 105a(2) EPC.
