This six-month period is calculated from the mention of the European search report's publication in the European Patent Bulletin. Where the applicant also has to respond to the search opinion, their response is required within this same period (see B-XI, 8 and C-II, 3.1). In such a case, the applicant's response to the search opinion is interpreted as the confirmation required by Rule 70(2), even where not explicitly expressed as such. If they fail to confirm their wish to proceed with the application in due time in reply to this invitation, the application will be deemed withdrawn. In this case, however, the means of redress provided for in Art. 121 (further processing of the application) will apply (see A-VI, 2.3 and E-VIII, 2). For the conditions applicable to a refund of the examination fee if the application is withdrawn, refused or deemed withdrawn, see A-VI, 2.5."

The time limit will not be affected by whether a supplementary European search pursuant to Art. 153(7) needs to be made or whether the international application is again published by the EPO pursuant to Art. 153(4). If the request for examination of a Euro-PCT application has not been filed within the time limit, the application is deemed withdrawn under Rule 160(1). In such a case, however, the applicant can file a request for further processing pursuant to Art. 121 (see E-VIII, 2). Where the Euro-PCT application is subject to the preparation of a supplementary European search report (see B-II, 4.3), once this report has been dispatched, a communication under Rule 70(2) is sent to the applicant inviting them to confirm the request for examination within six months of that communication's notification (see E-IX, 2.5.3)."

To avoid delays, care should be taken to comply with the requirements of Rule 137(4) when filing such amendments (see OJ EPO 2009, 533, point 7). Any amendments filed at this stage are made voluntarily by the applicant in accordance with Rule 137(2) (for more details, see C-III, 2.1). The applicant's response to the search opinion required by Rule 70a (or filed voluntarily in response to search opinions not requiring a response) will be taken into account by the examining division when drafting the first communication. Failure to respond to this communication in due time will result in the application being deemed withdrawn according to Art. 94(4), although this loss of rights is subject to further processing (see E-VIII, 2). With regard to what constitutes a valid response, see B-XI, 8. If the applicant accepts a search division's suggestion regarding an acceptable form of amendment of the claims to overcome the objections raised (see B-XI, 3.8), they are requested to adapt the description to the claims on file and delete or amend any statements or expressions throwing doubt on the scope of protection (see F-IV, 4.3). In exceptional cases, the examining division may decide to issue a summons to oral proceedings as the first action in examination proceedings (see C-III, 5). In such a case, the applicant's response to the search opinion will be taken into account when drafting the annex to the summons. If the European search report or supplementary European search report was accompanied by a search opinion but was drawn up before 1 April 2010 (such that a reply to the search opinion was not mandatory, see B-XI, 8) and the applicant did not reply to it, a communication referring to the search opinion and setting a time limit for reply is issued as the first communication under Art. 94(3).

The same applies to correct application documents or parts filed after the accordance of a filing date (see A-II, 6) under Rule 56a. The examining division may review the findings of the Receiving Section on the applicability of Rule 56(3) and Rule 56a unless there has been a decision of a board of appeal. Normally this review will have been initiated at the search stage (see B-III, 3.3.1 and B-XI, 2.1). However, it can still be started during substantive examination. For the criteria for determining whether the \"completely contained\" requirement of Rule 56(3) and Rule 56a is satisfied, see A-II, 5.4.2 and A-II, 6.4.1 respectively. Should the examining division conclude, contrary to the original finding of the Receiving Section, that the missing elements are not \"completely contained\" in the priority document, it will raise an objection under Rule 56 or Rule 56a in the first communication under Art. 94(3), presenting detailed arguments as to why the \"completely contained\" requirement is not satisfied. In addition, it will warn that non-compliance with the requirements of Rule 56(3) or Rule 56a(4) as applicable can result in redating, which in turn can lead to loss of a priority right if the redating causes the filing date to be more than 12 months after the claimed priority date. Note that if the review was initiated at the search stage and an objection under Rule 56 or Rule 56a was raised in the extended European search report (EESR), the applicant may already have submitted a response to the search opinion (required by Rule 70a or filed voluntarily in response to a search opinion not requiring a response). The examining division will treat this response in the same manner as the reply to the first communication. If the applicant replies by withdrawing the missing parts or the subsequently filed correct application documents or parts, the examination will continue as normal with the original filing date, but without the missing parts or the correct application documents or parts (see also A-II, 5.5 and F-III, 10). If the applicant succeeds in arguing in their reply that the \"completely contained\" requirement is satisfied, the examination will continue as normal with the missing parts or the subsequently filed correct application documents or parts, as the case may be, and with the original filing date. If the applicant maintains the missing parts or the subsequently filed correct application documents or parts and their arguments do not succeed, the examining division will issue a further communication under Art. 94(3) informing them of the application's impending redating to the date on which the EPO received the missing parts or the correct application documents or parts. This communication gives the applicant a further opportunity to withdraw the subsequently filed missing parts or the correct application documents or parts within a time limit of two months (Rule 132(2)) so as to restore the original filing date or to request an appealable decision on the redating. It indicates the reasons why the \"completely contained\" requirement is not met and also deals with any counter-arguments presented by the applicant. If the applicant does not reply to the above communication in due time, the application is deemed withdrawn (Art. 94(4)). If the applicant opts to withdraw the subsequently filed missing parts or the correct application documents or parts, the redating of the application will be deemed not made (see also B-XI, 2.1). The examiner will continue the examination procedure as normal with the original filing date but without missing parts and/or the correct application documents or parts (see also F-III, 10). If the applicant does not agree with the finding, they may (within two months (Rule 132(2)) request an appealable decision on the matter. In this case, the examining division will issue a reasoned decision informing them of the new filing date, the reasons for the redating and (where appropriate) the detrimental effect of the redating on the claimed priority right. This decision will allow a separate appeal according to Art. 106(2). Once the period for filing an appeal has expired without an appeal being filed, the examiner will resume examination on the basis of the new filing date. Note that the EESR may contain documents that could become relevant as a result of the redating. If the applicant files an appeal in due time, the file passes to a board of appeal to review the decision on the filing date's accordance. The examining division will not continue substantive examination while the case is pending before the board. Once the board has issued a decision, the file will be returned to the examining division, which will be bound on this point by the board's decision (Art. 111(2)). It will then resume examination on the basis of the filing date fixed by the board."

Incorporations by reference by the receiving Office under Rule 20.5bis(d) PCT, i.e. without changing the filing date, are effective before the EPO as designated or elected Office for international applications filed on or after 1 November 2022. For details, see the notice from the EPO dated 23 June 2022, OJ EPO 2022, A71. On entry into the European phase, the normal procedures apply on the basis that the correct and erroneously filed parts are thus part of the application as filed (see E-IX, 2). For international applications filed between 1 July 2020 and 31 October 2022, the provisions under Rule 20.5bis(d) PCT remain not fully applicable (see the notice from the EPO dated 14 June 2020, OJ EPO 2020, A81). The EPO adopts the following practice in respect of those applications: corrections accepted by the receiving Office during the international phase under either Rule 20.5bis(b) PCT or Rule 20.5bis(c) PCT â€“ i.e. where it accorded the date of receipt of the correct application documents or a later date as the filing date of the application or shifted the initial filing date of the application to the date of receipt of the correct application documents â€“ will be effective in proceedings before the EPO as designated/elected Office (see OJ EPO 2020, A81). However, if the receiving Office considered the correct application documents to be incorporated by reference under Rule 20.5bis(d) PCT, i.e. without changing the filing date, this incorporation will not be effective in proceedings before the EPO as designated/elected Office. In such cases, the EPO will, on entry into the European phase, consider the filing date of the application to be the date on which the correct application documents were received (Rule 20.8(c) PCT and Rule 20.5bis(b) or (c) PCT). Furthermore, it will consider the application as filed to include the correct application documents but not the erroneously filed ones. The EPO will inform the applicant about this in a communication under Rules 20.8(c) PCT and 82ter.1(c) and (d) PCT, setting a time limit of two months for reply. (i) If, within the time limit, the applicant requests that the correct application documents be disregarded under Rule 82ter.1(d) PCT, the EPO will issue an interlocutory decision changing the filing date to the date initially accorded by the receiving Office and confirming that the procedure before the EPO as designated/elected Office will be based on the application documents as filed on that date. (ii) If the applicant files observations with regard to the communication under Rule 20.8(c) PCT and Rule 82ter.1(c) and (d) PCT within the time limit set, the EPO will also issue an interlocutory decision taking into account the observations made. (iii) If the applicant does not file observations and does not request that the correct application documents be disregarded, an interlocutory decision will not be issued. In this case, the EPO will stick to its findings. Applicants interested in avoiding this procedure, namely the issuing of the communication under Rules 20.8(c) PCT and 82ter.1(c) and (d) PCT and the setting of a time limit of two months for reply, may make use of the abridged procedure. According to it, they may, within the 31-month time limit under Rule 159(1), at the time of validly requesting early processing or, at the latest, before the communication under Rules 20.8(c) and 82ter.1(c) and (d) PCT is issued: (a) request that the EPO disregard the correct application documents. In that case, no such communication but an interlocutory decision will be issued. This decision will confirm that the application maintains the initial filing date and that the correct application documents will be disregarded in the procedure before the EPO as designated/elected Office. (b) confirm that they wish to pursue the application with the filing date corresponding to the date of receipt of the correct application documents and with those correct application documents. In that case, no invitation and no interlocutory decision will be issued. The EPO will correct the filing date and consider the erroneously filed application documents not to have been filed. The applicant will be informed accordingly. Once the procedure described above has been finalised, a communication under Rules 161 and 162 will be issued and the applicant may amend the application within the scope of the disclosure on the filing date as determined in this procedure. As a consequence of the procedure described above, it may happen that the application documents as originally filed differ from those forming the basis for the search in the international phase. If the EPO acted as ISA, the examiner has to check carefully whether the invention forming the basis for the European phase was covered by a search in the international phase. If this is not the case, an invitation under Rule 164(2) will be issued (see C-III, 3.1). If the subject-matter forming the basis for European phase processing is covered by the international search report, then examination continues as usual but taking into account that the potential change of the filing date might have an impact on intermediary documents cited in the international search report and that the priority might not be valid anymore.

If the applicant makes amendments but does not identify them and/or indicate their basis in the application as filed (see H-III, 2.1) and the application is one of those mentioned in H-III, 2.1.4, the examining division may send the applicant a communication under Rule 137(4) requesting this information (see H-III, 2.1.1). If the applicant accepts a search division's suggestion regarding an acceptable form of amendment of the claims to overcome the objections raised (see B-XI, 3.8), they are requested to adapt the description to the claims on file and delete or amend any statements or expressions throwing doubt on the scope of protection (see F-IV, 4.3)."

                    "content": "Searches under Rule 164(2) For Euro-PCT applications where the EPO acted as ISA or as SISA, the examining division under Rule 164(2) assesses the application documents upon expiry of the six-month time limit set in the communication under Rule 161 and Rule 162. For any claimed invention or group of inventions within the meaning of Art. 82 not searched by the EPO in its capacity as ISA or SISA, the examining division issues an invitation to pay search fees. The application documents as amended may contain claims directed to a non-searched invention in situations other than where the application documents that are to serve as the basis for examination do not meet the requirement of unity of invention. For instance, the amended application may contain just one invention, but it may be an invention that was claimed but not searched by the EPO as (S)ISA in the international phase. In this case, there is no non-unity objection for this set of claims and the reasoning in the invitation needs only to refer to the non-unity objection in the WO-ISA and to the fact that no additional fee was paid for this invention during the international phase. It may well be that an invention in the application documents was not even claimed in the application documents that served as the basis for the procedure in the international phase and has been imported from the description (see F-V, 7.1(iv)). In such a case, an invitation to pay search fees under Rule 164(2) for any non-searched invention is to be issued by the examining division, irrespective of whether lack of unity persists in the claims. The invitation under Rule 164(2) must state that â€“ and why â€“ this is a new invention not searched in the international phase. If there are other inventions present in the claims that were also not searched (but were claimed in the PCT phase), the applicant must also be invited by way of the same invitation to pay further search fees in respect of those inventions. In assessing whether or not subject-matter present in amended claims constitutes a previously unclaimed invention imported from the description (for which an invitation under Rule 164(2) is to be sent), the principles laid down for assessing compliance with Rule 137(5) (see in H-IV, 4.1.2) are to be taken into account. The application documents forming the basis for the European phase may also cover inventions or groups of inventions not searched in the (supplementary) international search report as a result of the procedure for erroneously filed elements under Rule 20.5bis PCT (see C-III, 1.3). In this case too, an invitation to pay search fees under Rule 164(2) is to be issued by the examining division. The invitation under Rule 164(2) must be sent before any communication under Art. 94(3). For Rule 164(2) to apply, the claims must be sufficiently clear to allow the identification of a non-searched invention triggering the procedure under Rule 164(2). If the claims are so unclear that a non-searched invention cannot be identified, the first action must be to issue a communication under Art. 94(3) setting out the objections under Art. 84. Should it turn out later in the procedure that amended claims are indeed directed to a non-searched invention, the applicant must file a divisional application for any such subject-matter. Recourse to Rule 164(2) is not provided for if, as a result of further amendments or clarification, (further) non-searched inventions are identified, since the procedure under Rule 164(2) applies to the application documents as submitted by the applicant as the basis for examination. If auxiliary requests are submitted before a search under Rule 164(2) is performed, only the main request is taken into account for the purpose of the search (notwithstanding the exceptions relating to cases under Rule 62a or Rule 63 where main and auxiliary requests are both considered at the search stage, see B-VIII, 3.2.2 and B-VIII, 4.2.2). If any search fees are paid in due time, the results of the searches are communicated to the applicant as an annex to a communication under Art. 94(3) and Rule 71(1) and (2) or under Rule 71(3), as set out in Rule 164(2)(b). This annex is entitled \"Search result according to Rule 164(2)\". If the applicant pays the search fees in due time under Rule 164(2) and at the same time files a new set of claims, the search will be carried out and the written opinion issued for the claims on file upon expiry of the period under Rule 161 for which the invitation to pay was sent and the requested fees paid. The amended documents may, however, informally be taken into account by the examiner carrying out the search, where this appears appropriate. Applicants will have the opportunity to file amendments of their own volition after receiving the results of the search under Rule 164(2) annexed to the communication under Art. 94(3) (see H-II, 2.3). If search fees are not paid in due time under Rule 164(2), a communication under Art. 94(3) and Rule 71(1) and (2) or under Rule 71(3) will be issued and the examining division will require deletion from the claims of any subject-matter that was not searched either because a search fee under Rule 164(2) was not paid (see H-II, 6) or for a different reason (see H-IV, 4). Before the patent is granted, this subject-matter should be either deleted from the description and drawings or indicated as not forming part of the claimed invention (see F-IV, 4.3(iii)). A communication under Rule 164(2)(b) deals with all objections for each of the inventions searched in accordance with Rule 164(2). For claims relating to inventions already searched by the EPO in the international phase that have been amended but still lack unity, it is sufficient to argue in detail why lack of unity is still present. The communication, where appropriate, further requests the applicant to limit the application to a single searched invention (see Rule 164(2)(c)). It follows from Rule 164(2)(b) and (c) that the special procedure under Rule 164(2) as set out in H-II, 2.3 ends upon expiry of the time limit set in the communication issued under Rule 164(2)(b). This means that the applicant's right to make amendments of their own volition ends upon expiry of that time limit. Furthermore, the special procedure as set out in F-V, 7.1(iv), which exempts amendments from the requirements of Rule 137(5), first sentence, ends upon expiry of the time limit under Rule 161(1). Such amendments will result in an invitation under Rule 164(2)(a) and allow the applicant to obtain a search of unsearched subject-matter referred to in Rule 137(5). However, any amendments submitted after expiry of the time limit under Rule 161(1) are subject to the requirements of Rule 137(5), first sentence (see H-IV, 4.1.2). The EPO's obligations under Rule 164(2) are fulfilled and the applicant's rights under this rule are exhausted once a single communication under Rule 164(2) has been sent. It follows that in cases of cascading non-unity no (further) invitation under Rule 164(2) is sent. The same applies if, during the examination procedure, claims are added or existing claims amended so that they relate to non-searched inventions. Exceptional cases may arise where the following sequence of events has occurred in the international phase: (i) The EPO acted as ISA in the international phase (ii) The EPO acting as ISA invited the applicant to pay one or more additional international search fees in accordance with Art. 17(3)(a) PCT and Rule 40 PCT (due to a lack of unity according to Rule 13 PCT) (iii) The applicant paid at least one such additional search fee (iv) The additional search or searches led to a further objection as to a lack of unity a posteriori (a cascading lack of unity), resulting in one of the inventions identified in the invitation under Art. 17(3)(a) PCT and Rule 40 PCT being further subdivided and resulting in sub-inventions not originally identified in that invitation (v) The EPO did not search all such sub-inventions. In the above case, the EPO will invite the applicant to pay search fees for any such unsearched sub-inventions in the claims that are to form the basis for examination on expiry of the six-month period under Rule 161(1), in accordance with Rule 164(2). Where the EPO acted as SISA in accordance with Rule 45bis.9 PCT, it may make a finding of a lack of unity of the international application according to Rule 45bis.6(a) PCT. However, in the procedure before the SISA, the applicant cannot pay additional supplementary international search fees, and the supplementary international search report will be directed only to the invention or unitary group of inventions first mentioned in the claims (Rule 45bis.6(a) PCT). Where such an application contains unsearched inventions in the claims that are to form the basis for examination on expiry of the six-month period under Rule 161(1), a communication under Rule 164(2) is issued allowing the applicant to have these inventions searched upon payment of search fees and to pursue one of them in the examination proceedings. Rule 164(2)(b) provides for a right to amend the application in response to the results of any search under Rule 164(2). This means that applicants may make amendments of their own volition once in response to the communication under Art. 94(3) to which the search results under Rule 164(2) are annexed (H-II, 2.3)."

If such an objection was not raised, but the examining division nevertheless considers that the requirements of Art. 82 are clearly not met, the question of lack of unity will be addressed as early as possible during examination (see F-V, 7.1 and H-II, 6.3). When raising a finding of lack of unity or upholding an earlier one objected to by the applicant on the basis of unconvincing reasons, the examining division will invite the applicant to limit the application to one invention or group of inventions. In response to such an invitation, applicants must clearly indicate which searched invention they wish to prosecute further. If the response is unclear, the examining division must seek clarification before continuing with the examination (see T 736/14).",

In cases where a communication under Rule 164(2) has been sent (see C-III, 3.1), Rule 164(2)(c) requires the applicant to delete all unsearched inventions from the claims. Final responsibility for establishing whether the application meets the requirement of unity of invention ultimately rests with the examining division (see T 631/97). When considering the issue of unity, the examining division will consider both the reasons given in the search opinion and the applicant's response (see B-XI, 8 for details of when a response to the search opinion is required); for Euro-PCT applications where no supplementary European search report is prepared, the examining division will consider the reasons given in the WO-ISA, IPER or supplementary international search report prepared by the EPO and the applicant's response as required by Rule 161(1) (see E-IX, 3.2). In the absence of any convincing response from the applicant to the issue of unity as raised earlier, the examining division will normally initially uphold the position taken earlier (see B-XI, 1.2) and will then require deletion of all the inventions other than that which has been searched. If the examining division is convinced, e.g. by arguments from the applicant, that the opinion on unity at the search stage was incorrect, then an additional search is performed for that part of the subject-matter that is judged to be unitary with an invention that was searched (see B-II, 4.2(iii) and C-IV, 7.3) and the examination is carried out on those claims that comply with the requirement of unity of invention.

When the application enters the examination phase or, in the case of Rule 164(2), after the reply to the first communication, the examiner will check whether the claims on which substantive examination is based meet the requirement of unity of invention (Art. 82) and cover only subject-matter that has been searched. If the claims lack unity of invention, the applicant will be invited to limit the claims to one searched invention and to exclude all unsearched subject-matter from the scope of the claims. If, in reply to the objection raised by the examiner, the applicant fails to respond adequately (either by amending the claims or by submitting convincing arguments) and the non-unity objection can be maintained, the application may be refused under Art. 97(2) in conjunction with Art. 82 (see H-II, 6.3 and 6.4), provided that the right to be heard, which includes the right to oral proceedings if so requested (Art. 116(1)), has been respected.

A refund request should be handled promptly. If the examiner concludes that it should not be granted, the applicant is informed of the examining division's preliminary opinion in a communication under Art. 94(3). This preliminary opinion takes into account the arguments put forward by the applicant in their reply to the search opinion. The applicant is informed that they may request an interlocutory decision on the refund, allowing a separate appeal under Art. 106(2). If there is a pending request for oral proceedings, the applicant is also invited in the communication to clarify whether this request also applies to the issuing of the interlocutory decision on the request for refund. If the applicant confirms this to be the case, oral proceedings will have to be held before a negative decision on the request for refund can be issued. An interlocutory decision should be issued at the earliest opportunity, subject to the requirements of Art. 113(1), and not left until the final decision on the application. Of course, if the stage in the procedure when the examiner is in a position to issue the decision on the refund coincides with the issuing of either a Rule 71(3) communication or a decision refusing the application, then, in the former case, the interlocutory decision can be issued with the Rule 71(3) communication; in the latter case, the decision on the refund can be included in the decision refusing the application. The examiner ensures that the interlocutory decision issued on this matter clearly states that a separate appeal under Art. 106(2) is allowed. The same procedure applies to the refund of search fees paid under Rule 164(1) and (2). Rule 164(5) provides for a refund of any search fee paid under Rule 164(1) or (2) in line with Rule 64(2) (see A-X, 10.2.2). Where the applicant pays a search fee in response to the Rule 164(2) invitation and at the same contests the basis for requiring payment of a search fee and requests its refund under Rule 164(5), the examining division may deal directly with this issue in the communication under Art. 94(3) and Rule 71(1) or (2) that accompanies the search results under Rule 164(2). Such an immediate review of the applicant's request is not possible in cases under Rules 64(1) and 164(1) until the examining division assumes responsibility for the application. The review under Rule 64(2) or 164(5) is restricted to a reconsideration of the validity of the original finding under the circumstances existing at the time the Rule 64(1), 164(1) or (2) invitation was sent, taking into account only the prior art that was available at that time. For more details on the assessment of unity of invention, see F-V. The issue of refunds of additional international search fees paid to the EPO acting as ISA in response to an invitation under Art. 17(3)(a) PCT, however, does not arise in the European phase because these fees were paid in the international phase, which is closed by this stage of the procedure. The applicant may contest the payment of additional international search fees to the EPO acting as ISA by paying these under protest according to Rule 40.2(c) PCT. However, this must be done in the international phase (see also the decision of the President of the EPO dated 9 June 2015, OJ EPO 2015, A59, and the notice from the EPO dated 24 March 2010, OJ EPO 2010, 322)."

Further action upon examination of replies Examiners should be guided at this stage by the overriding principle that a final position (grant or refusal) should be reached in as few actions as possible, and should conduct the procedure with this always in mind. The EPC provides that the process of communicating with the applicant described in C-III, 4 is repeated \"as often as necessary\". In most cases, the applicant will have tried to deal with all the examiner's objections. A letter of reply from the applicant does not have to be substantively complete or cogent to qualify as a reply within the meaning of Art. 94(4). For the application not to be deemed withdrawn, it is enough for the applicant to comment on, even incompletely, or to file amendments in reply to at least one of the objections raised in the Art. 94(3) communication. In contrast, purely formal requests, such as for extension of the time limit under Art. 94(3) or for a consultation, do not qualify as replies under Art. 94(4) (see also B-XI, 8 and E-VIII, 2). A request for a decision according to the state of the file (see C-V, 15), however, qualifies as a reply within the meaning of Art. 94(4). If the only outstanding objection is the need to amend the description, see C-VI, 1.1. If examination of the applicant's reply shows that despite their submissions objections persist, and provided that at least one communication has been sent in examination proceedings (see C-III, 4 and E-IX, 4.1) and the applicant has been given the right to be heard (Art. 113(1)), i.e. the decision is based solely on grounds they have had an opportunity to comment on, the examiner will consider recommending to the other members of the examining division that the application be refused (see T 201/98). However, where there is a reasonable prospect that an additional invitation to overcome the objections could lead to a grant, the examiner will send a further written communication or contact the applicant by telephone. The examiner may also make suggestions on how to overcome the raised objections (see B-XI, 3.8 and C-III, 4.1.2). If examination of the applicant's reply shows that they have not dealt with all the main objections in their reply, it may be appropriate to draw the deficiencies to their attention, e.g. by telephone. But if no positive reaction is to be expected, the examiner should consider recommending to the other members of the examining division that the application be refused immediately (again provided that at least one communication has been sent in examination proceedings). If substantial differences of opinion exist, the issues are generally best dealt with in writing. If, however, there seems to be confusion about points in dispute, e.g. the applicant seems to have misunderstood the examiner's arguments or the applicant's own arguments are unclear, then a consultation may be useful. A consultation may also expedite the procedure if the matters to be resolved are minor. Consultations do not constitute oral proceedings (see E-III) and are more fully considered in C-VII, 2."

This is because, in general, the search files will not be complete in respect of such material at the time of the main search. Since priority dates claimed (if any) may not be accorded to all or part of the application but may be accorded to the appropriate part of a conflicting application (see F-VI, 2.1), this search should be extended to cover all European patent applications published up to eighteen months after the filing of the application under consideration. If the examiner is unable to complete this top-up search when preparing the search opinion or the first communication under Art. 94(3), they should ensure that it is completed before the application is reported to be in order for the grant of a patent. In the rare cases where the application is found to be in order before this search can be completed (e.g. due to a request for accelerated prosecution of an application not claiming priority, \"PACE\", see the notice from the EPO dated 30 November 2015, OJ EPO 2015, A93), the grant of a patent should be postponed until the top-up search can be completed. If the top-up search is performed at the earliest 18 months from the filing date of the application under examination, the priority situation needs to be checked only if intermediate documents and/or conflicting applications are retrieved. The top-up search may exceptionally be performed at the earliest 18 months after the priority date on condition that the priority claim is valid for the whole content of the patent application under examination. In addition to retrieving Art. 54(3) documents not available at the time of the original search, the top-up search takes into consideration potentially relevant prior art cited by other patent offices on applications belonging to the same patent family as the application under examination at the EPO and therefore needs to be performed for any file at the start and end of examination. The examiner may retrieve relevant intermediate and/or conflicting Euro- PCT applications for which it is not yet clear if they will become prior art under Art. 54(3) alone or in conjunction with Rule 165 (see G-IV, 5.2). In these cases, the examining division cannot issue an intention to grant before it can be established if these documents are prior art under Art. 54(3). The examiner will first check if the Euro-PCT application has entered the European phase at 31 months after the earliest priority date of the application. If not, it may still constitute conflicting prior art under Art. 54(3) if the PCT applicant has paid the required filing fee under Rule 159(1)(c) and has supplied the PCT application in any official EPO language. The examiner will then verify if the application has become prior art under Art. 54(3) in conjunction with Rule 165. Since August 2021, the EPO publishes these cases in section I.2(2) of the European Patent Bulletin under the heading \"International applications considered as comprised in the state of the art under Rule 165 and Art. 54(3) EPC\". For the refund of examination fees (see A-VI, 2.5), the launch of a top-up search is triggered at the start of examination. This creates a marker that serves as evidence in the file that the examining division has started its substantive work."

This may arise for a number of reasons. An additional search may be necessary: (i) where a partial search taking the place of the search report under Rule 63 has been issued at the search stage after an invitation under Rule 63(1) (see B-VIII, 3, 3.1 and 3.2) and the deficiencies rendering a meaningful search impossible under Rule 63 have been subsequently corrected by amendment complying with Rule 137(5) (see H-IV, 4.1.1) or successfully refuted by the applicant (ii) where a declaration that a meaningful search was not possible took the place of the search report under Rule 63 and the applicant successfully refuted the objections (iii) where the applicant successfully argues that a plurality of independent claims in the same category, which led to a limitation of the search report in accordance with Rule 62a (see B-VIII, 4.1 and 4.2), is in fact allowable according to the exceptions provided for in Rule 43(2) (see F-IV, 3.2) (iv) where a particular part of the application has not been searched because of an objection of lack of unity of invention and the arguments advanced by the applicant have convinced the examining division that unity is given (v) where the claims have been so amended that their scope is no longer covered by the original search (vi) where a search report under Rule 61 was issued containing no prior-art documents because the technical features were considered notorious (see B-VIII, 2.2.1) and the examining division does not share this opinion (vii) where no prior-art document was cited for features that were considered part of the common general knowledge and the examining division does not share this opinion or the common general knowledge is challenged by the applicant (see G-VII, 2 and 3.1) (viii) exceptionally, where the applicant states that a mistake was made in the acknowledgement of prior art (see G-VII, 5.1) or the examiner believes that material relevant to obviousness might be found in technical fields not taken into account during the search (ix) where the applicant has introduced a new priority claim after the filing date (see C-III, 6). If the application was filed under the PCT, the search report will be the international search report issued under the PCT and will be accompanied by a supplementary European search report unless the Administrative Council decides that that is to be dispensed with (see E-IX, 3.2). Both of these reports will have to be considered by the examiner when deciding whether any additional search is required. In the case of a Euro-PCT application for which the EPO acting as ISA or SISA issued an incomplete search report or a declaration of no search (see PCT-EPO Guidelines, B-VIII, 1), an additional search may be necessary if the deficiencies underlying the limitation of the search have been corrected by amendment or successfully refuted by the applicant (see B-II, 4.2 (ii)). Otherwise, the examining division will object to claims relating to subject- matter not searched by the EPO acting as ISA, referring to the EPC provision invoked for the limitation of the search, e.g. Art. 84. Rule 137(5), second sentence, cannot be invoked in that context. For searches under Rule 164(2), see C-III, 3.1."

This text may include amendments and corrections that the examining division made on its own initiative and can reasonably expect the applicant to accept. If in doubt as to whether the applicant will agree to the proposed amendments, the examining division should contact them by telephone or via an official communication. The applicant's agreement to such amendments during a consultation will usually be recorded in the communication under Rule 71(3) (see C-VII, 2.4). Examples of amendments not requiring consultation with the applicant: (a) amendment of a statement of invention in the description to bring it into conformity with the claims (b) deletion of vague general statements in the description (see F-IV, 4.4) or of obviously irrelevant matter (see F-II, 7.4) (c) insertion of values in SI units (see F-II, 4.13) (d) insertion of reference numerals in claims unless the applicant is known to object to this or has previously objected to this (e) introduction of a summary of background art that clearly represents the prior art closest to the invention (see F-II, 4.3) (f) amendments that, despite changing the meaning or scope of an independent claim, are very clearly necessary and so assumed acceptable to the applicant (see for example G-VI, 6.1.2, G-VI, 6.1.3 and G-VI, 6.1.4) (g) correction of linguistic and other minor errors (h) reformulation of method-of-treatment claims into an allowable format (see G-II, 4.2). (i) deletion of redundant claims (e.g. omnibus claims and claims that the applicant has not deleted despite having incorporated their features into other claims). Examples of amendments that may not be proposed without consulting the applicant: (i) amendments that significantly change the meaning or scope of a claim when there are several different ways to amend it and the examiner cannot predict which amendment the applicant will agree to (ii) deletion of entire claims, with the exception of so-called \"omnibus claims\" (i.e. claims reading \"An apparatus substantially as described herein\", or the like) (iii) combining of claims to overcome a novelty or inventive step objection. The above list is designed to avoid changes likely to be rejected by the applicant and thus to help avoid delays in the conclusion of examination proceedings. For the standard marks used by the division to indicate amendments and corrections using the in-house electronic tool, see C-V, Annex. The text is communicated to the applicant via a Rule 71(3) communication, which includes an invitation to pay the fee for grant and publishing (see C-V, 1.2) and to file a translation of the claims in the two official EPO languages other than the language of the proceedings (see C-V, 1.3) within a non-extendable period of four months. If the applicant pays the fees and files the translations in time (and files or requests no corrections or amendments to the text proposed in the Rule 71(3) communication, see C-V, 4.1), they will be deemed to have approved the text intended for grant (Rule 71(5)). If, during examination proceedings, a main request and auxiliary requests have been filed (see C-IV, 1 and E-X, 2.9) and one of the requests is allowable, the communication pursuant to Rule 71(3) is to be issued on the basis of the (first) allowable request unless there is a higher ranking request for oral proceedings (see E-X, 2.2). The communication pursuant to Rule 71(3) must briefly indicate the essential reasons for the non- allowability of the subject-matter of the higher-ranking requests or their inadmissibility (see also H-III, 3). The examining division should provide sufficient information about the objections raised to enable the applicant to comment on them. Handwritten amendments by the applicant to the description, claims and abstract, unless they involve graphic symbols and characters and chemical or mathematical formulae, are no longer accepted in strict compliance with Rule 50(1) in conjunction with Rule 49(2) (Art. 2(7) of the decision of the President of the EPO dated 25 November 2022, OJ EPO 2022, A113) (see OJ EPO 2013, 603, and A-III, 3.2).

If a renewal fee falls due after the Rule 71(3) communication's notification but before the next possible date for publication of the mention of the European patent's grant, the decision to grant is not issued and the mention of the grant is not published until the renewal fee has been paid. The applicant is informed accordingly. If the renewal fee or any additional fee is not paid in time, the application is deemed withdrawn (see A-X, 5.2.4). In rare cases where examination was accelerated to such an extent that the Rule 71(3) communication is issued before the designation fee falls due, the decision to grant will not be issued and the mention of the grant will not be published until the designation fee has been paid. The applicant is informed accordingly. For European patent applications filed before 1 April 2009 or international applications entering the regional phase before that date, publication will not take place until the designation fees have been paid and the designation of states for which no designation fees have been paid has been withdrawn (see also A-III, 11.1 and 11.3). The decision to grant does not take effect until the date on which the grant is mentioned in the European Patent Bulletin."

The examining division may also issue a summons to oral proceedings or, if the necessary requirements are met, refuse the application directly. The application may be refused directly if the following criteria are satisfied: (a) the grounds leading to the finding that the requests filed in response to the Rule 71(3) communication are inadmissible or not allowable have already been formally dealt with in examination proceedings (Art. 113(1)), for example in a communication under Art. 94(3) and Rule 71(1) and Rule 71(2) (see C-III, 4, E-X, 1.1); and (b) the applicant's right to oral proceedings on request has been respected (Art. 116(1)). If one of the following situations applies, the examining division will have to arrange for the holding of oral proceedings before issuing a decision to refuse (see C-V, 4.7.3): (i) oral proceedings have been requested but have not yet been held (ii) oral proceedings have been held, but: - the subject of the proceedings has changed such that a right to subsequent oral proceedings arises under Art. 116(1) (e.g. as a result of the amendments filed in response to the Rule 71(3) communication) and - the applicant has requested subsequent oral proceedings. Requests for oral proceedings must be allowed as long as proceedings before the EPO are still pending, i.e. until the decision to grant has been handed over to the internal post (see G 12/91 and T 556/95, especially reasons for the decision 4.4). 4.7.1.1 Higher-ranking request not admissible and/or not allowable If the applicant replies to the Rule 71(3) communication by requesting that a grant be based on a higher-ranking request but the examining division is not convinced by the arguments and evidence filed with their reply, the examining division resumes examination following the procedure in C-V, 4.7.1. The examining division may also directly refuse the application providing a full reasoning under the proviso that: - the short indication of the essential reasons given in the Rule 71(3) communication for the non-allowability of the subject-matter of the higher-ranking requests or the inadmissibility of these requests (see C-V, 1.1 and C-V, 4.6.2) provides sufficient information about the objections raised by the examining division to enable the applicant to comment on them (such that the applicant is not taken by surprise, in particular where amendments or corrections have been filed together with their disagreement; see C-V, 4.7.1) and - the applicant's right to oral proceedings on request has been respected (Art. 116(1)) (see also H-III, 3.3.2). For the purposes of determining whether the reasons not to grant the higher-ranking requests given in the Rule 71(3) communication allow the division to issue a refusal, a general indication such as \"Auxiliary request 3 is not clear because an essential feature is missing\" is not sufficient. Rather, a more detailed statement is needed to ensure that the applicant's right to be heard is properly respected. For example, the division may provide the applicant with an explanation such as: \"Auxiliary request 3 is not inventive in view of D1 (see col. 5, lines 25-46; fig. 4) because the skilled person, wishing to avoid friction between the cable and the carpet, would make the clip recess deeper than the cable diameter\"."

The basis for the refusal in this case is the absence of an application text agreed to by the applicant (Art. 113(2)).

The resumption of examination after approval is subject to the same considerations as resumption due to amendments filed in the Rule 71(3) period (see C-V, 4.7.1).

The examining division may also not refuse the application if the only communication issued is under Rule 137(4). If, despite the applicant's submissions, i.e. amendments or counter- arguments, objections persist after the applicant's reply to the first communication under Art. 94(3) in examination, then a refusal can be issued. If there is a pending request for oral proceedings, oral proceedings must be held and the decision to refuse will, where appropriate, be announced at the end of them. Similarly, if a summons was issued as the first action in examination, the decision to refuse will, where appropriate, be announced at the end of the oral proceedings. If a refusal is envisaged, the first member should bring the application before the other members of the examining division, who may then decide to refuse the application. In any event, the first member will always consult the other members of the division at some stage to establish whether an application should be refused or a patent granted. If the division intends to refuse the application, a written reasoned decision is necessary and this will normally be prepared by the first member (see E-X, 2.3 and E-X, 2.6). In preparing the decision, the first member must take care to abide by the general principles set out in Art. 113(1), i.e. the decision must be based on grounds or evidence that the applicant has had the opportunity to comment on (see E-X, 1.1 and E-X, 1.2). In addition, the applicant's attention must be directed to the provisions for appeal laid down in Art. 106 to Art. 108. If oral proceedings take place (see E-III), the decision may be given orally but must subsequently be notified in writing, the time limit for appeal then running from the date of such notification. If the applicant appeals against the decision and the examining division considers, in the light of the applicant's statement, that the appeal is admissible and well-founded, it should rectify its decision accordingly within three months after receipt of the statement of grounds. Otherwise, the appeal will be considered by a board of appeal. If a decision to refuse a patent is reversed on appeal, the application may be referred back to the examining division for further examination. In such a case, the further examination will normally be entrusted to the examiner who performed the original examination.

To comply with the requirement that such a decision be reasoned (Rule 111(2)), a number of conditions have to be met: (i) the previous communication must properly identify the application documents on file, be well-reasoned and complete with respect to the grounds and the reasons for the refusal of the current request and address all the arguments raised by the applicant (ii) no new arguments or amendments have been submitted by the applicant since the previous communication (iii) all objections raised in the previous communication referred to must still apply. If, in its reply to the last communication from the examining division, the applicant has submitted new arguments that are at least likely to be effective, these arguments cannot be ignored even if, in the same reply, the applicant has explicitly requested a decision according to the state of the file. In this case, the division must consider these freshly presented arguments either by issuing a regular reasoned decision (see C-V, 15.3) or by issuing a further communication (see C-V, 15.4). A decision according to the state of the file by means of a standard form can be based on minutes of a consultation if they contain a full exposition of all the legal and factual reasons for refusing the application, as in the case of minutes of a consultation issued as the first communication in examination (see C-VII, 2.5). Examining divisions are not to refer to the minutes of oral proceedings in decisions by means of a standard form. Although it is possible by way of exception to refer to more than one communication in the standard form, the examiner should carefully consider the requirements of Rule 111(2). In particular, if the different communications deal with different sets of claims, such that it is not clear which of the reasons given by the examining division in its communications might be essential to the decision to refuse, a fully reasoned decision should be issued instead (see C-V, 15.3)."

The period to be allowed will be determined by the examiner taking all the factors relevant to the particular application into account. These include the language normally used by the applicant or their representative; the number and nature of the objections raised; the length and technical complexity of the application; the proximity of the EPO to the applicant or, if they have one, their representative and the distance separating the two. If the only outstanding objection is the need to amend the description, the examiner may invite the applicant to amend the description by issuing a communication under Art. 94(3) with a two-month time limit to reply. Alternatively, the examiner may consult the applicant informally, e.g. by telephone, explain the objection and set a one-month time limit documented in the minutes of the consultation referring to this objection (unless a shorter limit is agreed during the consultation). This time limit can be extended if the applicant so requests before it expires (see E-VIII, 1.6). Failure to respond to a communication under Art. 94(3) and Rule 71(1) and (2) in due time results in the application being deemed withdrawn.

Such a consultation will preferably be held by videoconference so that, where necessary, documents can be presented, other persons participate and the identity of those attending verified (see C-VII, 2.2). The shared area in MyEPO Portfolio provides a space for applicants and examiners to upload documents and informally discuss changes (see OJ EPO 2023, A59). Consultations can also be held by telephone at the request of the applicant, if the situation so requires. The consultation may take place at the initiative of either the applicant or the examiner or formalities officer. However, the decision on whether it is to be held is up to the formalities officer or examiner. A consultation request from the applicant should usually be granted unless the nature of the issue to be discussed requires formal proceedings or the examiner believes that no useful purpose would be served by such a discussion. For example, where substantial differences of opinion exist in examination, written procedure or oral proceedings are normally more appropriate. Typical situations in which the applicant may want a consultation are: (i) to enquire about a procedural issue such as how to proceed in particular circumstances (note however that the examiner is not normally in charge of formal issues such as extensions of time limits and payment of fees); for enquiries as to the processing of files, see E-VIII, 7 (ii) where there appears to be an error in the communication or in the applicant's reply making it difficult for them or the examiner to prepare the next reply/communication (e.g. wrong document cited, communication based on wrong set of claims, new submissions referred to but not included). Typical situations in which the examiner may consider it appropriate to consult the applicant are: (iii) where there appears to be confusion about certain points in dispute, e.g. the applicant seems to have misunderstood the examiner's arguments â€“ or vice versa â€“ so that the written procedure is leading nowhere (iv) where the application seems to be ready for grant except that the examiner needs to clarify some minor issues with the applicant or would like to discuss a proposal for amendments to overcome the objections raised (v) where amendments or corrections requested by the applicant after the Rule 71(3) communication have been submitted but the examiner cannot agree to them. For consultations in response to the EESR before the application has entered the examination phase, see B-XI, 8. Telephone conversations held for the sole purpose of arranging a date for a consultation or oral proceedings do not in and of themselves constitute a consultation within the meaning of this section.

Regarding (c), see also A-VIII, 1.5. If the applicant is a natural or legal person having neither residence nor place of business in a contracting state, consultations may only be conducted with: - a professional representative (see A-VIII, 1.1) - a legal practitioner (see A-VIII, 1.4 and A-VIII, 1.5).

This can be done by inviting them to show an official identity document to the camera in the case of a videoconference or to send a copy of the document by email. For data protection reasons, the copy of the identity document sent by email will not be included in the file (see also E-III, 8.3.1).

The minutes should always indicate whether the next action is due to come from the applicant or the examiner. In this regard, the minutes when despatched to the applicant may: (i) be issued for information only, in which case if a time limit is still pending, it should be observed; if no time limit is pending, no action is required from the applicant (ii) be issued such as to extend a pending time limit, in which case the applicant must reply within that extended time limit (iii) be issued such as to set a new time limit for response, in which case the applicant must reply within this new time limit (iv) be issued such as to cancel a pending time limit (v) be issued such as to reflect the decision to cancel scheduled oral proceedings where an agreement on an allowable set of claims can be reached during the consultation. Cancellation of the oral proceedings is communicated to the applicant orally during the consultation and noted in the minutes. No separate communication regarding the cancellation of the oral proceedings is issued (vi) be issued for information only where the applicant announces during the consultation that they do not intend to attend oral proceedings. The applicant is informed that oral statements must be confirmed in writing to be procedurally effective (see C-VII, 2.3). Where the consultation is concerned with the clarification of obscurities, the resolution of uncertainties or putting the application in order by clearing up a number of minor points, it will usually be sufficient for the examiner to make a note in the minutes of the matters discussed and the conclusions reached or amendments agreed unless a time limit is set for reply (see below). Where the consultation involves the discussion of weightier matters, such as questions of novelty, inventive step, unity or whether the amendment introduces added subject-matter, a fuller note of the topics raised will be made in the minutes. In particular, the minutes will specify in concrete terms the topics discussed, together with any amendments agreed, any opposing views, the reasons for any change of opinion and any conclusions drawn unless these are clear from other documents in the dossier. Furthermore, the reasons for any amendments required by the examiner should be clearly indicated. It is important to avoid statements that are unclear, ambiguous or universally applicable in the minutes. For example, statements such as \"Amendments to the claims were proposed to take account of the prior art cited in the search report\" are of no assistance to members of the public, other members of the division or indeed the first member at later stages of the procedure. The same applies to conclusions worded in a generalised manner. If the minutes are sent as a first communication in examination, see C-VII, 2.5. The minutes are placed in the dossier, made available for file inspection (including all documents filed by an applicant or representative during the consultation) and sent to the applicant or their representative, even where the consultation merely changes/confirms/cancels the time/date of a proposed consultation. However, by way of exception, consultations relating to amendments agreed immediately prior to completing the Rule 71(3) communication may be reflected in that communication, provided that there is no uncertainty for the public as to what was agreed.

While acting on behalf of the examining division in all communications with the applicant up to that point, this examiner may confer informally with the other members of the division at any time on specific points of doubt or difficulty. The term \"examiner\" as used in this part of the Guidelines is normally understood to mean the \"first\" member. As stated above, the first member may seek the advice of other members of the examining division at any stage in the examination. However, there will come a point when it becomes appropriate for them to refer the case formally to the other members of the examining division. This will be when they consider the case to be in order to proceed to grant or, alternatively, where there seems no possibility of an amendment to overcome their objections or where the applicant has not overcome these objections, and when they consider the case to be in order to proceed to refusal. There are also other circumstances in which reference to the examining division is appropriate, e.g. oral proceedings may be suggested by the examiner or requested by the applicant because an impasse has been reached. In considering whether to refer the application to the division, the examiner should be guided by the principle stated in C-IV, 3. The first member should also bear in mind that when they issue a communication they do so in the name of the division, and the applicant is entitled to assume that if the examiner had doubts as to the views of the rest of the division, they would have discussed the matter with them beforehand. Although the examining division assumes ultimate responsibility for an application as soon as that application passes to it under Rule 10, formal matters are normally dealt with by a formalities officer (see the decision of the President of the EPO dated 12 December 2013, OJ EPO 2014, A6; OJ EPO 2015, A104). Examiners should not spend time checking the work of the Receiving Section or the formalities officer. However, they should refer an application to the formalities officer for further consideration if they believe the formalities report to be incorrect or incomplete. If required by specific circumstances (e.g. sickness), an application may be reallocated to another examiner/examining division. In such cases, the decision to reallocate will be taken by the line manager."

Once the division has been enlarged, communications or decisions must be signed by all four members. If the examining division has been enlarged to four members, the chair will have a casting vote. As a rule, enlargement will be required in cases involving technical opinions (Art. 25 â€“ see E-XIII, 3.1) and where evidence has to be taken according to Rule 117 (including the giving of evidence by witnesses â€“ see E-IV). It is also to be considered in the case of oral proceedings. Where an examining division has been enlarged pursuant to Art. 18(2) but the case is decided in a three-member composition, there should be clear evidence in the public file that a decision to set aside enlargement was taken by the division in its four-member composition prior to the final decision. Therefore, if enlargement is considered no longer necessary, the examining division will set it aside. This decision is not separately appealable. The applicant is informed about the setting aside of the enlargement in the communication accompanying and/or the annex to the summons or the decision following the setting aside of the enlargement. Depending on the nature of the problem, as an alternative to enlarging the examining division, it may be sufficient to consult a legally qualified member in Directorate Patent Law and Processes. For instance, doubts may arise whether an application concerns an invention within the meaning of Art. 52(2) or whether the claimed invention is excluded from patentability by virtue of Art. 53. Such consultation may also be appropriate where legal considerations predominate in a decision, as in proceedings following a request for re-establishment of rights according to Art. 122.

A European patent application may give rise to more than one divisional application, and a divisional application may itself give rise to one or more divisional applications. Divisional applications are to be treated the same as ordinary applications and are subject to the same requirements unless specific EPC provisions, in particular Art. 76 or Rule 36, require something different (G 1/05, G 1/06).

However, there are a number of special points to be considered (see also C-III, 5). The claims of a divisional application need not be limited to subject-matter already claimed in the parent application's claims. Furthermore, no abuse of the system of divisional applications can be identified in the mere fact that the claims of the application on which the examining division had then to decide had a broader scope than the claims granted in relation to the parent application (see T 422/07). However, under Art. 76(1), the subject-matter may not extend beyond the content of the parent application as filed. If a divisional application as filed contains subject-matter additional to that contained in the parent application as filed, it can be amended later so that its subject-matter no longer extends beyond the earlier content, even at a time when the earlier application is no longer pending (see G 1/05). If the applicant is unwilling to remedy the defect by removing that additional subject-matter, the divisional application must be refused under Art. 97(2) for failure to comply with Art. 76(1). The divisional application cannot be converted into an independent application taking its own filing date. Moreover, a further divisional application for this additional subject-matter should also be refused under Art. 97(2) for failure to comply with Art. 76(1). Amendments made to a divisional application subsequent to its filing must comply with the requirements of Art. 123(2), i.e. they may not extend the subject-matter beyond the content of the divisional application as filed (see G 1/05 and T 873/94). If the amendments have not been identified and/or their basis in the application as filed not indicated by the applicant (see H-III, 2.1) and the application is one of those mentioned in H-III, 2.1.4, the examining division may send a communication under Rule 137(4) requesting the applicant to provide this information (see H-III, 2.1.1). If the subject-matter of a divisional application is restricted to only a part of the subject-matter claimed in the parent application, this part must be directly and unambiguously derivable from the parent application as being a separate part or entity, i.e. one that can be used even outside the context of the invention of the parent application (see T 545/92). In the case of a sequence of applications consisting of a root (originating) application followed by divisional applications, each divided from its predecessor (see A-IV, 1.1.2), it is a necessary and sufficient condition for a divisional application of that sequence to comply with Art. 76(1), second sentence, that anything disclosed in that divisional application be directly and unambiguously derivable from what is disclosed in each of the preceding applications as filed (see G 1/06)."
