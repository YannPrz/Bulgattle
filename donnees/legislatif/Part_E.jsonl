Notifications may, where exceptional circumstances so require, be given through the intermediary of the central industrial property offices of the contracting states. In proceedings before the EPO, any notification to be made must take the form of the original document, or a copy thereof certified by or bearing the seal of the EPO, or a computer print-out bearing such seal, or an electronic document containing such seal or otherwise certified.

Even if the addressee can access the electronic document before the date of the document, the decisive date for the purpose of the notification fiction under Rule 127(2) is the date of the document. In the event of any dispute concerning the delivery of the electronic document, it is incumbent on the EPO to establish that the document has reached its destination and to establish the date on which it did so. If notification is contested and the EPO establishes that the document reached its destination more than seven days after the date it bears, a period triggered by the deemed receipt of that document will be extended by the number of days by which these seven days were exceeded (see the notice from the EPO dated 6 March 2023, OJ EPO 2023, A29). Rule 134(1) applies only once the period is extended according to the safeguard under Rule 127(2). See E-II, 2.4 for an example. Notification may occur in electronic form to an activated Mailbox. Electronic notification comprises the decisions, summonses, notices and communications contained in a list published on the EPO website. The Mailbox may also be accessed through MyEPO Portfolio. For further details, see the decision of the President of the EPO dated 9 October 2023 concerning the web-based online service MyEPO Portfolio (OJ EPO 2023, A89) and the notice from the EPO dated 9 October 2023, (OJ EPO 2023, A90).

The President of the EPO has, so far, not named any other documents to be notified by registered letter with advice of delivery or equivalent. A notified document is deemed to be delivered to the addressee on the date it bears unless it has failed to reach the addressee. In the case of notification irregularities, the safeguards set out in E-II, 2.3 apply. Example: An examination report under Art. 94(3) bears a date of 30 January 2024 and sets a time limit of four months. The report is delivered on 3 February 2024, which is four days after the date it bears. Thus, there will be no extension under the safeguard and the document will be deemed notified on 30 January 2024. The four-month period triggered by the notification on 30 January 2024 falls on 30 May 2024, on which no mail is delivered in Munich (public holiday). Consequently, the time limit is extended under Rule 134(1) until 31 May 2024. By contrast, if the document is delivered on 9 February 2024, i.e. ten days after the date it bears, the period will be extended by three days to expire on 2 June 2024 under Rule 126(2). Since 2 June 2024 is a Sunday, the period is further extended under Rule 134(1) to expire on 3 June 2024. Notification is deemed to have been effected, even if acceptance of the document has been refused. The law of the state on the territory of which the notification is made applies to other matters concerning notification, e.g. the question whether delivery to a person other than the addressee constitutes an effective notification to the latter."

The term does not include consultations such as occur in examination proceedings and limitation/revocation proceedings (see C-VII, 2). In view of Rule 81(2), such consultations are not allowed in opposition proceedings in which more than one party is involved unless the consultations concern matters which do not affect the interests of other parties. An example is proceedings for examining the admissibility of opposition, provided this involves only the EPO and the opponent concerned. Oral proceedings will take place before the competent body, e.g. within the Receiving Section before the appointed officer and during the examination and opposition procedure before the whole division. In matters lying within its competence, oral proceedings can be held before the Legal Division. Such proceedings are non-public in both ex parte and inter partes proceedings. The right to oral proceedings forms a substantial part of the right to be heard under Art. 113."

Examples of serious reasons are, in particular, reasons relating to a participant to the oral proceedings as an individual (e.g. a proven visual impairment that prevents a representative from following oral proceedings on screen) and reasons related to the nature and subject-matter of the proceedings (e.g. where they involve the demonstration or inspection of an object where the haptic features are essential, to the extent that this is possible in accordance with the applicable provisions). Sweeping objections against the reliability of videoconferencing technology or the non-availability of videoconferencing equipment will, as a rule, not qualify as serious reasons in this regard. Participants must ensure that their videoconferencing equipment meets the technical requirements specified. They are encouraged to perform a test call well before the oral proceedings take place. In addition to the summons, participants will receive an email confirming the date, time and the videoconference contact details to be used to establish the connection (in the form of a link or by other suitable means) and containing any further appropriate information, including on the organisation of the videoconference."

In particular, a request for oral proceedings made before the decision to grant or to limit has been handed over to the internal post has to be allowed (see T 556/95 and G 12/91). Oral proceedings will take place before the Receiving Section at the request of the applicant only where the Receiving Section considers this to be expedient or where it envisages refusing the European patent application. Where the Receiving Section does not consider it necessary to hold oral proceedings, it must inform the applicant accordingly (see J 16/02). The competent department will decide on the most appropriate date for the oral proceedings, which will only be held after the issues to be determined are sufficiently clear (see E-III, 5). With a conditional request for oral proceedings, i.e. if any party concerned has indicated that the request for oral proceedings has been made solely as a precaution to cover the eventuality that the case they have put forward is not accepted, oral proceedings will be held only if a negative decision against the party concerned is envisaged. With an unconditional request for oral proceedings, if the competent department considers that a decision on the matter may be reached on the basis of the written evidence on file and intends to take a decision (e.g. in accordance with Art. 97, 101 or 105b) which fully concurs with the case put forward by the party or parties having unconditionally requested the oral proceedings, and providing there is no valid request for oral proceedings from a party adversely affected by the decision envisaged, the decision may be issued in writing without oral proceedings being held (T 1050/09)."

            "content": " Oral proceedings, particularly in opposition proceedings, are held to give the opportunity to finally discuss all matters raised and are normally terminated with a decision announced orally. The division is bound by that decision, once announced, and it cannot reopen the proceedings to allow further submissions to be filed or to take into account new facts (see the last two paragraphs of E-VI, 2). Only if the division, in the oral proceedings, has not announced a decision, but has decided to continue the proceedings in writing, can further submissions be examined. Such may be the case e.g. when the examining division indicates that it intends to grant a patent (or to limit a granted patent in limitation proceedings) on the basis of the documents filed during the oral proceedings. Thus, as a rule, in examination, limitation or opposition proceedings there will be no justification for further oral proceedings, for example where one of the parties wishes to re-examine from a different viewpoint a subject already discussed in the course of the proceedings, either before or during the original oral proceedings. However, if the oral proceedings are not terminated with a decision and after the oral proceedings the subject of the proceedings changes, for example where fresh evidence is admitted into the proceedings after the original oral proceedings, then further oral proceedings will generally have to be held if requested (see T 194/96). 4. Oral proceedings at the instance of the EPO The competent department of the EPO may arrange for oral proceedings to take place without a request from a party if it considers this to be expedient. Oral proceedings will normally only be expedient if after an attempt at written clarification there are still questions or doubts which have a crucial bearing on the decision to be reached and which may be more efficiently or surely settled by oral discussion with the party or parties, or if it is necessary to take evidence as part of oral proceedings (see E-IV, 1.3 and 1.6.1).

In so far as certain questions relevant to the decision are considered by the EPO to require discussion, it will in many cases be expedient to inform the party or parties in a notice and possibly also to invite one or more of the parties to submit written observations or to produce evidence, where appropriate. Parties may produce evidence in support of their arguments on their own initiative. Where, however, the evidence is such that it should have been put forward at an earlier stage, e.g. in opposition proceedings pursuant to D-IV, 1.2.2.1(v) and 5.4, it is for the competent body to consider whether the evidence not filed in due time is to be admitted (see E-VI, 2). Any observations should be received in time for them to be communicated to the other parties at the latest one month before the oral proceedings. The time limit for submission of observations is fixed accordingly, particularly where the invitation to file observations is issued at the same time as the summons to oral proceedings."

            "content": " The division sets a single date for the oral proceedings, i.e. one day or, in particular cases, more than one consecutive day. No pre-announcement of the date will be made. Oral proceedings may be set for any working day on which the EPO is open at the relevant site. The summons will be accompanied by a note drawing attention to the points which need to be discussed, normally containing the provisional and non-binding opinion of the division. New documents may be cited in the annex to the summons (T 120/12), together with an explanation of their significance. However, examiners must carefully consider on a case-by-case basis whether citing a new document would introduce a new line of argument. At an early stage in the procedure, they must consider sending a further communication before issuing any summons if a new document needs to be cited. For the additional requirements of the accompanying note if the summons is issued as the first action in examination, see C-III, 5. The summons as well as the annexed communication can only be appealed together with the final decision unless a separate appeal is allowed (see E-X, 3). The summons will also fix a date up to which written submissions may be filed or amendments which meet the requirements of the EPC may be submitted (see also D-VI, 3.2). Rule 115(1) stipulates that at least two months' notice of the summons must be given unless the parties agree to a shorter period. Such agreement must be present in the public part of the file. Harmonised with the standards applied in the written procedure (E-VIII, 1.2), the practice outlined below is followed in setting the date of the oral proceedings to allow the parties sufficient time for preparing and filing submissions: (i) Any time limit (even shorter than two months) may be set provided that prior agreement has been reached with the parties. (ii) Normally, the summons is issued at least four months ahead of the day of the oral proceedings in examination and at least six months ahead of the day of the oral proceedings in opposition. (iii) Between two and four months' notice can be given without preliminary agreement only in specific circumstances, since the parties would have very limited time for filing submissions before the date fixed in the summons. Examples are where, in examination, the summons follows an extensive exchange between the first examiner and the applicant, where oral proceedings have been adjourned due to a lack of time, or where the date of the oral proceedings is changed to a later date (see also E-III, 7.1.3). (iv) Where the summons is issued as the first action in examination, six months are foreseen between the despatch of the summons and the date of the oral proceedings (see C-III, 5). The summons must state that if parties duly summoned do not appear as summoned or fail to connect to the oral proceeding by videoconference, as the case may be, the proceedings may continue without them. In opposition proceedings, where multiple oppositions have been filed, as a rule, a single hearing in oral proceedings is scheduled, even if the oppositions are based on different grounds (see D-I, 6). This means that all the parties must be summoned to attend them and may present comments on all grounds raised."

The request to fix another date must be filed as soon as possible after the grounds preventing the party concerned from attending the oral proceedings have arisen. It must be accompanied by a sufficiently substantiated written statement indicating these reasons (see OJ EPO 2009, 68; see also T 178/03) and appropriate evidence, where necessary. Serious reasons to request a change of the date for oral proceedings may be, for instance: - a previously notified summons to oral proceedings of the same party in other proceedings before the EPO, the Unified Patent Court or a national court or patent office - for the same date or - for the preceding or following day or - for at least one of the two preceding or two following days where participation in the oral proceedings requires travelling to or from a geographically distant location, - serious illness, - a death within the family, - the marriage of a person whose attendance in oral proceedings is relevant, - military service or other obligatory performance of civic duties, - business trips which have been firmly booked before notification of the summons to oral proceedings, - holidays which have already been firmly booked before notification of the summons to oral proceedings. In the case of holidays scheduled but not yet booked, the representative must indicate the circumstances (e.g. school holidays) which prevent the holidays from being rescheduled. If the grounds for changing the date of the oral proceedings submitted by a party do not meet the above criteria, the division will inform the parties that the oral proceedings will take place as set out in the summons and annex a brief reasoning as to why in its view the criteria are not met. The reasons that can be invoked to change the date only apply to those participants whose presence is essential to the oral proceedings, e.g. the representative or a witness. If during the procedure substantive submissions were made by several representatives of a firm, an indication must be given why none of those who previously made such submissions can present the case at the oral proceedings, i.e. why the representative who cannot attend is essential or why the others are also unable to attend. In opposition proceedings, in particular if more than one opponent is involved, a more strict approach may be applied to prevent a series of changes of date (see T 1102/03). Grounds which, as a rule, are not acceptable are, for instance: - a summons to oral proceedings before the EPO or a national court notified after the summons in the relevant proceedings, - excessive work pressure. As Mondays and Fridays are normal working days, oral proceedings will be scheduled for these days, too. The fact that this may necessitate travel at weekends is not a sufficient reason to change the date of the oral proceedings. The departments of first instance will however, circumstances permitting, try to be flexible where there is a request to change the starting time in order to enable the party to travel on the same day."

If the division decides that oral proceedings are nevertheless to be conducted, this means that there are objections still outstanding that need to be discussed at the oral proceedings. Consequently the applicant and/or patentee can expect that problems relating to the requests filed in reply to the summons to oral proceedings will be dealt with at the oral proceedings. If any applicant or patentee decides not to attend the oral proceedings, they are thereby choosing not to make use of the opportunity to comment at the oral proceedings on any of the objections, but to rely on the arguments as set out in the written submissions.

Oral proceedings, including delivery of the decision (see E-III, 9), are public before the opposition divisions in so far as the opposition division does not decide otherwise in cases where admission of the public could have serious and unjustified disadvantages, in particular for a party to the proceedings. This could, for example, be the case if any of the parties wishes to give information about sales figures or other commercial secrets in support of their case. Generally, the public will only be excluded whilst such information is being given. The public is also excluded during discussions about a request for exclusion of a document from file inspection (see D-II, 4.3) and when a decision on the matter is pronounced. The parties other than the requester(s), as well as their representatives, may also be excluded as being part of the public (e.g. in the case of a request for exclusion of a medical certificate from file inspection). Members of the public may be granted remote access to opposition oral proceedings via a link provided upon request. See OJ EPO 2022, A106, for details about the request and the conditions."

For other representatives, authorised employees and accompanying persons (including those who will be making oral submissions, see E-III, 8.5) present for a given party, it is sufficient that their identity is confirmed orally by the person whose ID documents were checked or who is personally known to at least one member of the division. This applies independently of whether a representative is a professional representative or a legal practitioner. Equally, if a party is not represented but personally present together with an accompanying person, it is sufficient to check the ID document of that party. However, the division checks the ID documents of all parties, witnesses and experts summoned to give evidence before the EPO. Moreover, the division may check ID documents of other attendees where this is considered necessary, e.g. because the identity of an accompanying person is challenged by another party or where the division has serious doubts about the identity of the person. The identity document may be presented in one of following ways: - If the identity document is an EPO badge, by showing it to the camera at the beginning of the videoconference in the public meeting room. - If the identity document is a national ID card or passport, by showing it to a member of the division in a separate non-public meeting room. - By sending a copy to the email address provided to the parties at the beginning of the oral proceedings. - By using the EPO online filing options up to two days prior to the oral proceedings. For data protection reasons, copies of identification documents sent by email are deleted and not included in the file; copies submitted via the EPO online filing options are placed in the non-public part of the file. In order for the division to be able to confirm the identity of the person concerned, the full name (first name and surname) and the picture of the ID should be visible. All the other information on the identity document can be kept hidden if so wished, as long as it is possible to recognise that it is an official identity document. Professional representatives need to file authorisations only in exceptional cases (see the decision of the President of the EPO dated 12 July 2007, Special edition No. 3, OJ EPO 2007, L.1). Authorisations need be checked only if a party is represented by a person whose authorisation is not apparent from the file. If it is established that the person is either (i) a professional representative acting under a sub-authorisation (ii) a professional representative from the same agency as the representative acting in the case, or (iii) a natural person (e.g. executive director) authorised by law in the party's country of business to act on behalf of that party then no further check is required. If however the person is: (a) a professional representative who is neither from the same agency nor acting under a sub-authorisation, and his/her attendance at the oral proceedings is his/her first appearance in the procedure, or (b) a legal practitioner or a party's employee who is not an authorised professional representative then the procedure is as follows: In case (a), the division will check the file to see whether the previous representative's authorisation has lapsed. A change in representative or the termination of the authorisation of a previous representative may have been effected via an electronic notification through the My Files service (see OJ EPO 2012, 352). If the previous representative's authorisation has lapsed, no further action is required. If not, the representative concerned will be requested to provide a reference to a registered general authorisation or to file an individual authorisation. In case (b), the division will request the person concerned to provide a reference to a registered general authorisation or to file – by email in the case of oral proceedings by videoconference (OJ EPO 2020, A71) – an individual authorisation. Any person without an authorisation will be requested to submit one without delay. If they are unable to do so straight away, a time limit of two months will be set for its submission. The fact that the authorisation was missing, and the time limit set for submitting it, must be recorded in the minutes. The proceedings then continue in the normal way, except that no decision can be pronounced at the end. Instead, the decision is issued in writing once the missing authorisation has been filed. At the end of the proceedings, the party concerned must be reminded to file the authorisation."

A new date must be fixed for further oral proceedings. If any party who has been duly summoned to oral proceedings does not appear as summoned or fails to connect to the oral proceedings by videoconference, as the case may be, the oral proceedings may be conducted without them, since a party should not be able to delay issuance of a decision by failing to appear or connect. It is to be noted that if any party appears or connects before the end of the oral proceedings, they have the right to be heard. If the party appears or connects only after the proceedings have been closed, the division may reopen them at its discretion, subject to two conditions: (a) the division has not pronounced a decision under Art. 97(1) or (2) or Art. 101(2) or an interlocutory decision under Art. 106(2) maintaining the patent in amended form according to Art. 101(3) (see also D-VI, 7.2.2) or a decision to reject the request for limitation under Rule 95(4). (b) all parties to the proceedings agree to the reopening. If, however, an allowable request for a change of date of oral proceedings has been filed (see E-III, 7.1.1), the proceedings are postponed and a new date fixed. If the filing of the request was delayed due to the carelessness of the party concerned, the proceedings may, depending on the circumstances, still be postponed; if this happens in opposition proceedings, a decision on the apportionment of costs may have to be taken (see D-IX, 1.4). 8.3.3.2 Procedure in opposition proceedings If new facts or evidence are submitted during inter partes oral proceedings which a party, although duly summoned, fails to attend, it must first be examined whether these submissions may be disregarded (Art. 114(2); see also E-VI, 2). Following G 4/92, if new facts are taken into consideration, then at the end of the oral proceedings a decision based on these facts cannot be taken against the absent party. Further, new evidence can only be used against the absent party if it has been previously notified and merely supports the previous assertions of the party who submits it. However, new arguments may be used at any time, in so far as they do not change the grounds on which the decision is based. In other words, what the Enlarged Board of Appeal ruled out in G 4/92 was the possibility of taking decisions against the absent party on the basis of a surprising course of events at the oral proceedings, which changes the legal and factual framework of the case in an unforeseeable way (see T 414/94). An absent party cannot be considered taken by surprise if during oral proceedings the other side attempts to overcome objections raised before the oral proceedings. In particular, a submission during oral proceedings of a more restricted and/or formally amended set of claims with a view to overcoming the objections of the opponent is not considered a \"new fact\" (see T 133/92 and T 202/92). Nor is it unexpected that amended claims are examined for formal admissibility and for compliance with Art. 123(2) and (3) (see T 341/92). In the particular case of an absent opponent, if new prior art is submitted for the first time during oral proceedings which may be an obstacle to the maintenance of the opposed patent, this new prior art can be taken into consideration despite the opponent's absence because it is in the opponent's favour (see T 1049/93). 8.3.3.3 Procedure in examination proceedings Oral proceedings give applicants an opportunity to exercise their rights under Art. 113(1). In examination proceedings, when applicants file amended claims before oral proceedings which they subsequently do not attend, they may expect a decision based on objections which might arise against such claims in their absence. A decision can be taken based on facts and arguments presented earlier in the proceedings and/or based on new arguments which may be expected to be raised. In examination proceedings, the annex to the summons to oral proceedings must include all the objections that are likely to be discussed during oral proceedings and indicate that amended claims in response to the communication will have to be examined at the oral proceedings for compliance with the EPC. This ensures that the applicant's right to be heard (Art. 113(1)) is respected and that the proceedings are not delayed unnecessarily if an applicant does not attend oral proceedings. Where auxiliary requests are filed before the summons to oral proceedings is issued, these requests must be commented on in terms of both admissibility and allowability. However, the reasoning given in the preliminary opinion is to focus on the main request; only a brief indication of the essential reasons for the non-allowability of the subject-matter or the non-admissibility of the auxiliary requests is to be provided. It is to be noted that this brief indication of the essential reasons for not allowing or not admitting the auxiliary requests has to be thorough enough to ensure that the applicant has been informed of the objections raised by the examining division and has thus been given the opportunity to comment on them (see C-V, 1.1 and C-V, 4.7.1.1)."

In the normal course of events each party will have only one opportunity of making a comprehensive statement. In opposition proceedings the opponents will generally speak first and the patent proprietor afterwards. Where there are a number of opponents, it may be expedient to grant the patent proprietor an opportunity of replying directly after the statement of each individual opponent. The opponents and the patent proprietor will be given the opportunity of making a final reply. The submissions of the party or parties may be prepared in writing, although they are expected to be made extemporaneously as far as possible. Passages from documents already introduced into the proceedings which are referred to again may only be read out where their precise wording is relevant. Submissions by a person who is not qualified under Art. 133 and 134 to represent parties to proceedings before the EPO may be admitted at oral proceedings when this person accompanies a professional representative representing that party. Such submissions, however, cannot be made as a matter of right, but only with the permission and at the discretion of the examining or opposition division or the Legal Division. In opposition proceedings the division will consider in exercising its discretion whether (see G 4/95): (i) the party on behalf of which the person is to speak has filed a request to this effect; (ii) the party making the request has indicated the name of the person, the subject-matter of the submission and the person's qualification to speak on this matter; (iii) the request has been filed sufficiently in advance of the oral proceedings; (iv) in the case of a late-filed request, either there are exceptional circumstances justifying the admission of the submission or all the other parties agree to the making of the submission; and (v) the submissions are made under the continuing responsibility and control of the professional representative. If neither of the alternative conditions mentioned under (iv) are met, a late-filed request will be refused. The time limit to be applied when deciding whether a request was late-filed is that fixed in the summons under Rule 116. If a party is represented by an authorised employee rather than a professional representative, the same considerations apply in respect of a person accompanying the authorised employee. As no other party is affected, examining divisions can adopt a more liberal approach than opposition divisions. Parties are not to be considered as accompanying persons in the sense of G 4/95 (see T 621/98). They have the right to make submissions in oral proceedings by virtue of their status as party to the proceedings. If written submissions are made during oral proceedings, the division will make sure that requirements such as typed-form, signature and dating of the submissions are met (T 733/99).

Generally, screens are available in most meeting rooms; however, requests to provide further equipment such as projectors will be refused. Care must be taken that presentations of computer-generated slideshows do not negatively impact the efficient conduct of oral proceedings (e.g. interruptions for the technical preparations for the presentation). Similar considerations apply to the use of other visual aids (e.g. flipcharts, pictures, screensharing). 8.5.1.1 Opposition proceedings (inter partes) As a prerequisite, copies of the material to be presented must be provided in good time before the oral proceedings, i.e. Rule 116 applies. These copies are treated like any other submission made in writing. The opposition division will decide whether the presentation of a computer-generated slideshow would facilitate the proceedings, after having heard the parties and taking into account whether allowing or refusing the use of the presentation would be detrimental to any participant. A balance must be found between the presenter's interest in defending the case in the most appropriate manner and the other party's need to fully understand the submissions made and to have a true opportunity to respond. The presentation of computer-generated slideshows in oral proceedings will be allowed if in the absence of this visual aid it would be much more difficult to follow the party's submissions. For example, slides showing: (a) the structure or functioning of a product which is complex, or (b) complicated reaction schemes, (c) complex formulae, or (d) the operation of a complex apparatus might be considered by the opposition division to facilitate the discussion. If copies of the material to be presented have not been filed in good time, or if the slides contain new matter, the presentation may be disregarded under Art. 114(2) and Rule 116. In this case the opposition division will apply the same criteria for admissibility as are used for other late-filed facts or evidence (see E-VI, 2). 8.5.1.2 Examination proceedings (ex parte) As no other party is affected, examining divisions may adopt a more liberal approach than opposition divisions. Therefore, examining divisions will consider allowing the presentation of a computer-generated slideshow even if the slides are not communicated in advance of the oral proceedings, provided that: (a) the examining division feels able to deal with this late-filed material without unduly lengthening the proceedings. The same considerations as for other late-filed facts and evidence apply (see E-VI, 2); (b) the submissions contribute to the resolution of the questions at issue."

This also applies to authorisations. Where filed documents require signature, this signature is preferably applied to the attached document. Alternatively, it may appear in the text of the accompanying email, which will also be annexed to the minutes. The signature must take the form of a string of characters (such as an email signature with the sender's name and position) or a facsimile signature. The documents are to be sent to the email address indicated during the videoconference by the competent department. Any emails and attached documents filed by a party during oral proceedings with more than one party will be forwarded by the division to the other parties present at the proceedings unless the party in question has already sent them direct to the email address indicated by the other parties. Therefore, each party must communicate to the division and, where possible, to the other parties at the beginning of the oral proceedings the email address it wishes to use for receiving copies of such documents. Parties and representatives must ensure that they can immediately take note of any document sent to the email address indicated by them. Amended application documents are to be filed as attachments. Attachments containing these amended application documents must be in PDF format and must comply with the WIPO Standard for Filing and Processing in Electronic Form (Annex F of the Administrative Instructions under the PCT). Where an attachment containing these amended application documents is not in PDF format or does not comply with the WIPO Standard or is illegible or incomplete, the party must be promptly informed during the videoconference. Where the deficiencies cannot be remedied during the videoconference or within the time limit set, that document (or that part of the document which is illegible or incomplete) is deemed not to have been received. Other attachments may be sent in any format which can be opened by the division and which can be reproduced in a legible form. Otherwise they are deemed not to have been filed. If an attachment is infected with a computer virus or contains other malicious software, it will be deemed to be illegible. The EPO is not obliged to receive, open or process any such attachment. No paper documents need be filed to confirm documents filed by email. All submissions made by email during a videoconference must be annexed to the minutes unless the exceptions under Rule 144 and the decision of the President of the EPO dated 12 July 2007 concerning documents excluded from file inspection apply (see A-XI, 2.3 and Special edition No. 3, OJ EPO 2007, J.3). A confidentiality note which is routinely included in emails is not to be regarded as a request to exclude these submissions from the public file. If the division consents, a party may present its screen for illustrative purposes. An item displayed in that way will not be considered as a document submitted by that party."

Responsibility for formally correct submissions and, in particular, for compliance with these requirements lies with the applicant/proprietor. Deletions, correction of the numbering of the figures and insertion of reference numbers and associated arrows in drawings are considered as typewritten amendments. If the oral proceedings take place by way of exception on the premises of the EPO, the parties may use the EPO's technical facilities that allow for compliance with the formal requirements, in particular computers equipped with a word processor and a printer, network printers and copiers enabling documents to be printed from a USB stick, and internet access in public areas via a public wireless network (see OJ EPO 2013, 603). Parties are recommended to prepare electronic copies of documents likely to be amended. Published patent applications and specifications are available via the European publication server.

However, a final decision granting a patent may be taken only on the basis of documents which are formally compliant. If the applicant is unable to provide formally correct amended application documents during oral proceedings, the following applies: (a) If a decision to refuse a patent application is imminent and formally non-compliant documents making up the application are on file, to avoid prolonging the proceedings the examining division will go ahead and issue the decision, based on substantive arguments. It may however mention this formal deficiency in the decision. (b) If there is agreed patentable subject-matter, the examining division announces the following: - the amended application fulfils the requirements of the EPC except for certain formal requirements, e.g. the ones regarding handwritten amendments; and - the procedure will be continued in writing.

The proprietor may choose to submit a formally compliant version of the amended text only within the time limit under Rule 82(2) (OJ EPO 2016, A22). The parties will nevertheless be encouraged to file compliant documents during oral opposition proceedings. In contrast, in written opposition proceedings, an interlocutory decision to maintain the patent as amended may be issued only on the basis of formally compliant documents since the invitation in Rule 82(2) applies only to documents filed during oral proceedings (see H-IV, 5.3). If, in oral proceedings, the interlocutory decision of the opposition division was based on documents which do not comply with Art. 2(7) of the decision of the President of the EPO dated 25 November 2022, i.e. which contain handwritten amendments, the opposition division will invite the proprietor in the communication under Rule 82(2) to file a formally compliant version of the amended text. The invitation will specify the formally deficient amended paragraphs and/or claims for which replacement paragraphs and/or claims need to be filed. The same applies where a decision of the boards of appeal remits the case to the department of first instance with the order to maintain the patent on the basis of amended documents with handwritten amendments. In reply to the invitation of the opposition division under Rule 82(2) the proprietor will have to submit replacement paragraphs and/or claims which contain a formally compliant verbatim reproduction of the text as determined by the interlocutory decision (or the decision of the board of appeal). Any divergence between the text matter of the formally deficient paragraphs (and/or claims) specified in the invitation under Rule 82(2) and the text of the replacement paragraphs (and/or claims) will trigger a communication under Rule 82(3). A communication under Rule 82(3) will also be sent, if the proprietor does not reply at all or not in time, if the replacement paragraphs and/or claims are incomplete or if the replacement paragraphs and/or claims are again formally deficient. If a formally compliant version of the verbatim text of the specified amended paragraphs (and/or claims) is not submitted within two months from the notification of the communication under Rule 82(3), the patent will be revoked."

The period for appeal will only begin to run from the date of notification of the written decision. Generally speaking it will not be possible to give a decision granting a European patent or maintaining it in amended or limited form in oral proceedings since, in the case of the grant of a patent, the requirements laid down in Rule 71(3) to (7), and in the case of a patent being maintained in amended or limited form, the requirements of Rule 82(1) and (2) or Rule 95(3) must be fulfilled.

They must contain the essentials of the oral proceedings and the relevant statements made by the parties, together with arguments relevant to the decision and not contained in the parties' written submissions. Details of the arguments raised by the parties, however, are developed in the decision, and therefore are only briefly reported in the minutes. Relevant statements are, for example, new or amended procedural submissions or the withdrawal thereof, the fresh submission or amendment or withdrawal of application documents, such as claims, description and drawings, and statements of surrender. The essentials of the oral proceedings include new statements by the party or parties and by the member or members of the department concerning the subject-matter of the proceedings. In examination and opposition proceedings, the essentials are principally new statements arguing the presence or lack of novelty, inventive step and other patentability criteria. The minutes are not, however, expected to be an exhaustive recollection of everything that was said during the oral proceedings. Rather, they are limited to the essentials and are as brief and concise as possible. Vague or general statements are to be avoided. Also, care must be taken to ensure that statements crucial to the decision are correctly recorded. Although this is normally not necessary, in case of doubt the record of such statements is read out to the parties concerned before the decision is taken and announced. Requests from parties for recording specific statements are accepted if the statements form part of the essentials of the oral proceedings and are relevant for reaching the decision. Otherwise, they may be refused since recording statements that a party considers might be useful in subsequent proceedings is not the function of the minutes. See E-III, 10.2 for the language requirements. If new facts or evidence are submitted during the oral proceedings, the minutes must make clear that the division has examined them under Art. 114(1). They must also indicate whether or not the division, after having heard the parties, subsequently disregarded them under Art. 114(2). The minutes briefly summarise the following elements, where present: (a) arguments relevant for the decision as submitted by the parties, which, if they are already known from the written procedure, can be referred to as such, (b) the substance of any new requests by the parties, preferably in the form of a brief statement referring to documents containing these requests, which must be attached to the minutes, and (c) objections, arguments and/or requests to the parties voiced by a member of the division, focusing on the points relevant for the decision which are developed in the grounds for the decision. The minutes conclude by indicating the decision taken by the division or, if no final decision is taken, the outcome of the proceedings. This part is preceded by a record of the parties' final requests as indicated in point (b) above. The minutes must also contain procedural information, such as how the proceedings are to be continued after closure of the oral proceedings or whether the public was excluded for the whole or part of the oral proceedings. The structure of the minutes mirrors the course of oral proceedings (see E-III, 8 and sub-points). If a decision is given (see E-III, 9), it must be reproduced in the minutes.

                    "content": "Means of evidence The party or parties may at any time during proceedings submit evidence in support of alleged facts (see E-III, 5, E-X, 1.2, D-IV, 5.3, D-IV, 5.4 and D-VI, 3). This must be done at the earliest opportunity. When such evidence is such as could have been put forward at an earlier stage it is for the competent department to consider whether it is expedient (see E-VI, 2) to allow the new evidence to be introduced. It is generally desirable for parties to produce evidence in respect of all the facts alleged in support of their case, in order, for example, to show whether a particular technique was generally known to industry or whether there was any prejudice against a particular technique. Facts adduced by a party will, however, normally be deemed true, even without supporting evidence, if it is clear that no doubts exist concerning them, if they do not contradict one another or if no objection is raised. In such cases the facts need not be supported by evidence. There will however be occasions, particularly in opposition proceedings, in which the arguments of the party or parties must be supported by evidence. This will for example be the case where reference is made to prior art, for instance in the form of an oral description, a use or perhaps a company publication and there is some doubt as to whether, and if so when, such prior art was made available to the public. The means of evidence which are admissible in proceedings before the EPO are (non-exhaustively) listed in Art. 117(1): - production of documents; - hearing the parties; - hearing witnesses; - sworn statements in writing; - requests for information, for instance from a publisher concerning the date of publication of a book - opinions by experts (see E-IV, 1.8.1); and - inspection. The most appropriate way of obtaining evidence in the individual case depends on the facts which have to be proven and on the availability of the evidence. To prove prior use in an opposition, the opponents usually offer as evidence the production of documents, the hearing of witnesses or parties, or they present sworn statements in writing. It is at the opposition division's discretion to evaluate this evidence, there being no fixed rules as to how any category of evidence is to be judged (for the evaluation of evidence, see E-IV, 4). If the documents produced (e.g. patent documents) leave no doubt as to their contents and date of availability to the public and are more relevant for the patent in suit than other evidence offered, reasons of procedural efficiency may lead the opposition division to not pursue the other evidence at first. If the testimony of a witness is offered, the opposition division may decide to hear this person in order to verify the facts for which this witness is brought forward, e.g. the prior use of the claimed product in an undertaking or the existence of an obligation to secrecy. For adequate substantiation the notice of opposition must make clear these facts, as witnesses are meant to serve for corroboration of facts brought forward, not for supplying these facts in place of the opponent. The above applies likewise to hearing the parties (see also E-IV, 1.6). The \"sworn statements in writing\" referred to in Art. 117(1)(g) are unknown in some national legal systems, which instead have their own instruments (see T 558/95). Whether a written statement (\"affidavit\") is made under oath or not is only one of the criteria applied by the opposition division in its evaluation of the evidence adduced. Apart from its relevance for the case, other criteria are the relationship between the person making the statement and the parties to the proceedings, the personal interest of that person, the context in which the statement was made, etc. Such a statement does not go beyond its literal content and does not allow the opposition division to assess the associated or background factors. If the alleged facts are contested by the other party, the opposition division does not generally base its decision on such a statement, but summons the person making the statement as a witness, if so offered by the party. The ensuing hearing of the witness allows the opposition division and the parties to put questions to the witness and thus enables the opposition division to establish the facts on the basis of that person's testimony. If that person is not offered as a witness, the opposition division will not pursue this evidence further. Inspection will enable direct observations to be made and direct impressions to be formed of the object or process concerned. It may, for example, involve the demonstration of a product or process requested by the applicant or proprietor of the patent to substantiate the method of operation of the subject-matter of the patent where this is disputed by the examining or opposition division. Evidence in the form of documents normally stays on the file. Only exceptionally and on reasoned request can documents filed as evidence be returned unconsidered, e.g. if they were third-party statements filed in breach of a confidentiality agreement and the other parties agree to the request (see T 760/89)."

The evidence of witnesses is normally taken at oral proceedings either on the premises of the EPO or by videoconference. A party, witness or expert can even be heard by videoconference if the oral proceedings are otherwise conducted on the premises of the EPO. For details see OJ EPO 2020, A135. The hearing will be either public or non-public, depending on the oral proceedings themselves (Art. 116(3) and (4)). Where a hearing is held in connection with oral proceedings, the considerations set out in E-III, 8.2, E-III, 8.3, E-III, 8.9 and E-III, 8.10 are directly applicable, and where this is not the case they apply mutatis mutandis. The hearing of an \"expert\" in the sense of Rule 117 requires as a precondition a decision to take evidence (see E-IV, 1.4). This is different from hearing oral submissions by a person accompanying the representative during oral proceedings, which can be allowed at the discretion of the division (see G 4/95 and E-III, 8.5)."

The minutes will normally be taken down by a member of the competent department carrying out the taking of evidence. The most efficient way of noting testimony is by way of dictation on to a dictating machine, in the process of which the person hearing the evidence will summarise the testimony in small sections, taking into account any objections raised by the persons being heard, and dictate it in this form on to a dictating machine. If the dictated passage does not correspond in full to their testimony, the persons being heard must raise any objections immediately. This is pointed out to them at the beginning of their testimony. At the end of their testimony, they will be asked to approve the dictated minutes, which they will have listened to as they were dictated. Their approval or any objections are to be included in the dictated text. The dictated minutes are typed out and the parties are provided with a copy as soon as possible. It is not necessary to play back the minutes or to obtain approval of them if the testimony has been recorded verbatim and directly, using technical means. Where the taking of evidence includes an inspection, the minutes must record, in addition to the essentials of the proceedings, the results of the inspection.

The competent body may make the taking of evidence conditional upon deposit with the EPO by the party who requested the evidence to be taken of a sum the amount of which is to be fixed by reference to an estimate of the costs. This procedure is applied where at the request of a party to grant or opposition proceedings evidence is to be taken by hearing witnesses or seeking an expert opinion unless no costs will arise because the witnesses or experts have waived their right to indemnification. If the party requesting evidence to be taken does not comply with the requirement of making such a deposit, the evidence need not be taken. In opposition proceedings the party requesting the evidence bears the costs of indemnifying witnesses or experts unless for reasons of equity in individual cases other arrangements are made for the apportionment of costs under Art. 104(1) in conjunction with Rule 88. Any shortfall between the deposit lodged and the amounts payable by the EPO under Rule 122(4), second sentence, is fixed by the EPO of its own motion. Any unused amount of the deposit lodged is refunded.

The proceedings under the EPC are governed by the principle of free evaluation of evidence. This principle allows, and requires, a competent department to decide according to its own discretion and conviction, by taking into account the entire content of the parties' submissions. There are no firm rules according to which certain types of evidence are, or are not, convincing. This does not mean that the evaluation of evidence may be arbitrary, rather the evidence must be assessed comprehensively and dutifully. The only decisive factor is whether the department is convinced of the truth of the factual allegation, i.e. how credible the department classifies a piece of evidence. To do this, the department must put all the arguments for and against a factual statement in relation to the required standard of proof. In doing so, the department remains bound by the laws of the logic and by probability based on experience. The department sets out in the decision the reasons for reaching its conclusions (G 2/21). The principle of free evaluation of evidence may not be used to simply disregard an admissibly submitted piece of evidence that is relied upon by a party in support of an inference that is challenged and is decisive for the final decision, for example to prove the presence of a technical effect. Disregarding it as a matter of principle would deprive the party of a basic legal procedural right enshrined in Art. 113(1) and 117(1). For example, the mere fact that evidence is post-published is not a sufficient reason not to take it into account. The state of the art to be taken into consideration in individual cases for the purposes of Art. 54 is that laid down in G-IV, 1 to 5 and 7 and G-V. The competent department is not obliged to take into consideration any facts or evidence not presented by the parties in due time, except within the limits specified in E-VI, 2."

Example: The opponent asserts that the preamble to claim 1 is described in document A, the characterising portion in document B (facts). To prove this, documents are submitted (evidence). The opponent then contends that the method claimed does not involve an inventive step, because the skilled person, on the basis of common general knowledge, would have combined the submitted documents in such a way as to arrive at the subject-matter of claim 1 (argument). Evidence admissible in EPO proceedings is not confined to that listed in Art. 117(1). \"Taking of evidence\" within the meaning of Art. 117 comprises the submission or gathering of evidence of any kind, particularly the filing of documents. Pure arguments are not evidence (see T 642/92)."

If not, the assertion is no longer considered and the evidence is not examined further. If the alleged fact is relevant, the next point is whether it is proven by the evidence submitted. When evidence is examined, since the EPC says nothing about how the outcome of taking of evidence must be assessed, the principle of unfettered consideration applies. This means that its content and its significance for the proceedings are assessed in the light of the particular circumstances of each individual case (e.g. time, place, type of evidence, position of witness in firm, etc.). The principle of unfettered consideration also means that EPO departments are empowered to evaluate evidence submitted by the parties in any appropriate manner, or indeed to disregard it as unimportant or irrelevant. In particular it has to be decided on a case-by-case basis when a particular piece of evidence is sufficient. When deciding whether an alleged fact is accepted, the division may use the criterion of the \"balance of probabilities\", which means that it is satisfied that one set of facts is more likely to be true than the other. Furthermore, the more serious the issue, the more convincing must be the evidence to support it (see T 750/94). For example, if a decision might result in revocation of the patent in a case concerning alleged prior use, the available evidence has to be very critically and strictly examined. In particular, in the case of alleged prior use for which little if any evidence would be available to the patentee to establish that no prior use had taken place, the division has to cede to the stricter criterion close to absolute conviction, i.e. beyond any reasonable doubt (see T 97/94). When parties make conflicting assertions, the division must decide which evidence is the most convincing. If it cannot establish which allegation is right on the basis of the evidence put forward, it must decide on the basis of the burden of proof, i.e. against the party bearing that burden but unable to prove its point convincingly."

The observations may be made either in oral proceedings following the taking of evidence or exceptionally in writing after transmission of the minutes of the taking of evidence. The decision on this matter will rest with the competent department. The parties may file requests accordingly. Only when this has been done may the competent department proceed to evaluate the evidence. Where a witness's testimony which is crucial to the decision has been challenged by a party but the department regards it as credible, or where a witness's oral or written testimony is disregarded in its decision as being not credible, the department concerned must state the grounds for its view in its decision. In evaluating a witness's oral or written testimony, special attention is to be paid to the following: (i) what is important is what witnesses can relate concerning the points at issue on the basis of their own knowledge or views, and whether they have practical experience in the field in question. Second-hand assertions based on something heard from third parties are for the most part worthless on their own. It is also important from the point of view of the evaluation whether the witness was involved in the event himself or only knows of it as an observer or listener; (ii) in the event of long intervals of time (several years) between the event in question and the testimony, it is to be borne in mind that most people's power of recall is limited without the support of documentary evidence; (iii) where testimony appears to conflict, the texts of the statements concerned are closely compared with one another. Apparent contradiction in the testimony of witnesses may sometimes be resolved in this way. For example, a close examination of apparently contradictory statements by witnesses as to whether a substance X was commonly used for a particular purpose may show that there is in fact no contradiction at all, in that while one witness was saying specifically that substance X was not used for that particular purpose, the other witness was saying no more than that substances like X, or a certain class of substances to which X belonged, were commonly used for this particular purpose without intending to make any statement regarding substance X itself; (iv) an employee of a party to the proceedings can be heard as a witness (see T 482/89). The possible partiality of a witness determines how the evidence is assessed, not whether it is admissible (see T 443/93)."

According to these decisions, in principle, the opposition is to be examined to the extent and on the grounds submitted during the period for opposition. Under Art. 114(1) the opposition division may go beyond this framework if prima facie maintenance of the patent is prejudiced. The principles developed by the Enlarged Board with respect to new grounds also apply to late-filed facts and evidence (see T 1002/92). Therefore late-filed facts and evidence are to be admitted into the proceedings only if they are prima facie relevant, i.e. if they would change the envisaged decision, see E-VI, 2. If a patent proprietor replies to a notice of opposition by amending the patent, such a request for amendment cannot be considered as late-filed and has to be admitted into the proceedings (Rule 79(1)). Thus, if the proprietor limits the patent to the subject-matter of a dependent claim as granted, new facts and evidence submitted by the opponent in reply to this amendment are as a general rule to be treated as late-filed and only to be admitted under Art. 114(1) if they are prima facie relevant because the opponent must be prepared for this type of amendment and must have provided material during the nine-month opposition period. If the new facts and submissions are not prima facie relevant, they are to be disregarded under Art. 114(2). An exception to this rule is where the patent specification as granted contained a large number of dependent claims and the opponent could not reasonably have been expected to deal with all of them in the notice of opposition. If, however, the proprietor amends the patent at an early stage of the proceedings in a manner not foreseeable by the opponent, e.g. by taking up features disclosed in the description, the opponent will have the opportunity to provide new facts and evidence, i.e. possibly even to submit a new ground for opposition and new documents. Such a submission has to be admitted into the proceedings because the subject of the proceedings has changed. At a late stage in the proceedings such unforeseeable amendments are subject to the criterion of \"clear allowability\" (see H-II, 2.7.1)."

For instance, if the opposition division states in the annex to the summons that the patent is likely to be revoked, and a timely filed request for amendment is admitted but relates to subject-matter not covered by the claims as granted, the subject of the proceedings has changed. Consequently, new facts and evidence submitted by the opponent in response to these requests will be admitted into the proceedings, even if they arrive after the final date set under Rule 116. However, if the proprietor's requests relate to amendments based only on claims as granted, new facts and evidence submitted by the opponent will be treated as late-filed even if submitted before the final date, i.e. they will be admitted only if they are prima facie relevant unless there are other aspects militating in favour of admitting them, such as a large number of dependent claims in the patent as granted (E-VI, 2.1).

The examining or opposition division has the discretion to disregard amendments filed after the date set under Rule 116(1) as being late-filed unless they have to be admitted because the subject of the proceedings has changed. Amendments submitted before the date set under Rule 116(1) cannot, as a rule, be considered as being late-filed. The following are examples of what would normally constitute a change of subject of the proceedings: - the opposition division admits under Art. 114(1) new facts and evidence or a new ground of opposition because they are prima facie relevant; - the examining division cites a further relevant document for the first time (H-II, 2.7); - the examining or opposition division departs from a previously notified opinion: for example, contrary to its preliminary opinion set out in the annex to the summons, the opposition division concludes during oral proceedings that an objection prejudices the maintenance of the patent. In these examples, a request from the applicant or proprietor for a corresponding amendment cannot be rejected as being late-filed even if submitted after the date set under Rule 116(1). If, however, after a change of opinion by the division, the applicant or proprietor files a new request that reintroduces subject-matter against which the division has already raised an objection, the division has discretion to disregard the new request due to it being prima facie not allowable. On receipt of amendments filed after the final date set under Rule 116(1), the division therefore first analyses whether the amendments were filed in due course in response to a change of the subject of the proceedings.

The division will in the first place have to consider the relevance of the late-filed facts or evidence (see E-VI, 2) or the allowability of the late-filed amendments on a prima facie basis. If these facts or evidence are not prima facie relevant, i.e. if they do not appear to affect the outcome of the proceedings (T 320/15), or if these amendments are not clearly allowable (see H-II, 2.7.1), they will not be admitted. For instance, if the opposition division states in the annex to the summons that the patent is likely to be revoked and the proprietor in response submits amendments after the final date set under Rule 116(1), possibly not until the oral proceedings, the division could, in principle, treat such requests as late-filed and apply the criterion of \"clear allowability\" (see H-II, 2.7.1) in judging whether they can be admitted into the proceedings. However, the division will consider admitting such requests into the proceedings if they relate to the subject-matter of dependent claims as granted. Convergence of requests is another of the relevant factors that the division may consider when exercising its discretion (for a definition of convergence, see H-III, 3.3.2.2). For the purpose of admissibility, a late-filed document's relevance is normally decided relative to the amended claims against which it is cited. Documents that have limited relevance to an initial set of claims may acquire new relevance as a result of subsequent amendments to those claims (T 366/11). Before admitting these submissions, the division will next consider procedural expediency, the possibility of abuse of the procedure (e.g. one of the parties is obviously protracting the proceedings) and the question whether the parties can reasonably be expected to familiarise themselves in the time available with the new facts or evidence or the proposed amendments. As regards procedural expediency, where the late-filed facts or evidence are relevant but their introduction would cause a prolonged adjournment of the proceedings, the division may decide not to admit these facts or evidence in the proceedings. An example would be where the witness still has to be found or lengthy tests are still necessary. The division may, however, also postpone the proceedings and in doing so may have to consider the apportionment of costs in opposition proceedings (Art. 104). Similarly, if late-filed requests are based on subject-matter not previously covered by the claims, they will normally not be admitted into the proceedings also for reasons of procedural efficiency. Admission of such requests could give rise to a postponement of oral proceedings and to a decision on apportionment of costs. Examples of possible abuse of the proceedings would be: - The patent proprietor introduces at short notice a proliferation of auxiliary requests which are not a reaction to the course of the proceedings. - The opponent knowingly abstains from raising an assertion of public prior use based on its own activities until late in the proceedings, even though the evidence in its support had become fully available earlier (see T 534/89). - The applicant or patent proprietor presents a large number of requests or incomplete variants of requests and invites the division to choose, shifting the responsibility for determining the content of the application or patent to the division. It is the duty of any party to proceedings to make its own case and to formulate its own requests (see T 446/00). Concerning the question of whether the parties can reasonably be expected to familiarise themselves in the time available with the new facts or evidence or the proposed amendments: - It may only become apparent in the oral proceedings that the pending request submitted to overcome grounds for opposition is not allowable under the EPC. The opponent must always expect to have to discuss subject-matter based on dependent claims as granted if they are reasonable in number. - The proprietor is in principle free to withdraw previously submitted amendments and defend the patent as granted unless this would constitute an abuse of the proceedings."

This means that the division must give the parties the opportunity to put forward arguments and duly consider them before deciding on the admissibility of the new ground. Similarly, where the opponent files pertinent new material, the patent proprietor must be given a chance to present comments and submit amendments. If the opposition division approves the introduction of new facts or evidence and if the other parties have not had sufficient time to study them, it grants, where easily comprehensible subject-matter is involved, the parties an opportunity to familiarise themselves with it, possibly by briefly interrupting the oral proceedings. If this is not feasible, the other parties must, upon request, be given the opportunity to comment in the proceedings subsequent to the oral proceedings, where appropriate in a further set of oral proceedings. Where possible, however, oral proceedings will not be adjourned.

Note in this respect that according to G 1/95 and G 7/95, Art. 100(a) does not constitute one single ground for opposition, but has to be considered a collection of individual grounds for opposition, i.e. individual legal bases for objection to the maintenance of a patent. This applies not only to distinctly different objections, such as subject-matter which is not patentable (Art. 52(2)) as compared to subject-matter which is not capable of industrial application (Art. 57), but also to an objection for lack of novelty as opposed to an objection for lack of inventive step. New arguments based on facts, evidence and grounds constituting the legal and factual framework of the opposition cannot be disregarded. In deciding whether to admit facts, evidence or grounds for opposition not filed in due time, their relevance to the decision, the state of the procedure and the reasons for belated submission are to be considered. If examination of late-filed grounds for opposition, late-filed facts or late-filed evidence reveals without any further investigation (i.e. prima facie) that they are relevant, i.e. that the basis of the envisaged decision would be changed, then the competent department has to take such grounds, facts or evidence into consideration no matter what stage the procedure has reached and whatever the reasons for belated submission. In that case, the principle of examination by the EPO of its own motion under Art. 114(1) takes precedence over the possibility of disregarding facts or evidence under Art. 114(2) (see T 156/84). Note, however, the limits on the obligation to undertake further examinations as set out in E-VI, 1.2. Otherwise, the department informs the party concerned in the decision, with due regard to Art. 113(1) (see T 281/00), that the facts, evidence and/or grounds for opposition were not submitted in due time and, since they are not relevant to the decision, will be disregarded pursuant to Art. 114(2). On the apportionment of any costs arising from the late filing of facts and evidence, see D-IX, 1.4. The latest date up to which submissions can be considered at all is the date on which the decision is handed over to the EPO's internal postal service for transmittal to the parties (see G 12/91). The above applies in written proceedings; in oral proceedings submissions can only be considered up to the pronouncement of the decision (see E-III, 9)."

Such observations must be filed in writing in English, French or German and must include a statement of the grounds on which they are based. The person filing them may not be a party to the proceedings before the EPO. The web interface provided by the EPO is the preferred means of filing such observations (see OJ EPO 2017, A86). Observations may be filed anonymously. Documentary evidence and, in particular, publications submitted in support of the arguments may be filed in any language. However, the EPO may request that a translation into one of its official languages be filed within a period to be specified; otherwise the evidence will be disregarded. Although third parties are sent acknowledgment of the receipt of their observations (if these were not filed anonymously), the EPO does not specifically inform them of any further action it takes in response to them. However, the outcome of the evaluation by the competent division will briefly be indicated in the respective office action from the EPO (e.g. in a communication or in the intention to grant) and will thus be visible to the public. The observations, including those filed anonymously, become part of the file. They are communicated without delay to applicants or proprietors, who may comment on them. If they call into question the patentability of the invention in whole or in part, the examining or opposition division will take them into account in the next office action. If the observations relate to alleged prior art available other than from a document, e.g. from use, this is taken into account only if the alleged facts either are not disputed by the applicant or proprietor or are established beyond reasonable doubt. Observations by third parties received in examination after dispatch of a Rule 71(3) communication but before the decision to grant (EPO Form 2006A) has been handed over to the EPO postal service will be considered by the examining division. If they are relevant, the examining division will resume examination. Otherwise, brief substantive feedback will be provided in the file. Observations by third parties received after the decision has been pronounced in oral proceedings (e.g. in the case of a refusal or in opposition) or issued in written proceedings and handed over to the EPO postal service (e.g. in the case of a grant decision or if, in opposition, no oral proceedings were held), will be included in the file without taking note of their content. Observations by third parties received once proceedings are no longer pending will be neither taken into account nor made available for file inspection. They will however be made available for file inspection and considered if the proceedings before the EPO become pending again, e.g. upon the start of any opposition or limitation proceedings. The EPO will make every effort to issue the next office action within three months of receipt of third-party observations under Art. 115 by the examining division, provided the observations are substantiated and have not been filed anonymously. Where the observations are received at a time when a reply from the applicant to a communication is outstanding, this period starts from receipt of the reply at the EPO. The EPO will generally apply the practice regarding third-party observations filed in the Euro-direct procedure mutatis mutandis to third-party observations filed during the international phase upon entry of the Euro-PCT application into the European phase. Where a third-party observation was filed during the international phase, the EPO as designated/elected Office will consider its content upon entry into the European phase once this becomes available to it. The examining division will make every effort to issue the next office action within three months after expiry of the period under Rule 161, but only on condition that the third party has clearly expressed its wish to achieve expedited treatment in the European phase, that the observation was filed non-anonymously and that it was substantiated. A third party wishing to achieve such a result in the European phase must, therefore, make this clear in the observation or file the observation with the EPO as designated/elected Office."

The date is set in such a manner as to allow this person to familiarise himself with the matter.

A decision to stay the proceedings or refusing a request to stay is not separately appealable; it can only be appealed together with the final decision on the application/patent (see E-X, 3). During the stay of proceedings, a PACE request will have no effect. After their resumption, proceedings are again accelerated.

A stay of proceedings due to dependency on a referral to the Enlarged Board of Appeal is to be distinguished from a stay of proceedings pursuant to Rule 14 (see E-VII, 2). 4. Consolidation of proceedings The examining or opposition division or the Legal Division may consolidate proceedings if this is considered useful in order to expedite proceedings in the specific circumstances of the case (see J 17/92). Consolidation is considered inter alia if the parties and the underlying facts of the proceedings are identical. It is for the responsible division to decide whether proceedings are to be consolidated in the interest of procedural efficiency and with a view to expediting proceedings and, if so, for what purpose. Consolidation may concern the entire procedure or only individual procedural steps such as the taking of evidence or the conduct of oral proceedings. The parties are to be informed of consolidation. This information includes a statement about the purpose of consolidation. Where proceedings are consolidated for the taking of evidence, this is to be notified in the order to take evidence and in the annex to the summons to oral proceedings. These must be sent to all parties to the consolidated proceedings. Likewise, submissions from the parties filed in respect of only one of the proceedings which are relevant to the consolidated parts of the proceedings must be included in all the files concerned. Upon fulfilment of its purpose, consolidation is to be set aside and the proceedings are to be continued separately. Again, the parties must be informed accordingly. A decision to consolidate proceedings is not subject to a separate appeal but may be appealed only together with the final decision unless the decision allows a separate appeal (see E-X, 3).

Some of these are fixed by the articles of the EPC, e.g. Art. 87(1) (priority period) and Art. 99(1) (opposition).

However, in order to facilitate the work of parties and the EPO it has been decided, as a general rule, to adopt a uniform practice with respect to time limits. This practice is at present as follows: (i) if deficiencies to be corrected are merely formal or merely of a minor character; if simple acts only are requested, e.g. under Rule 83 the subsequent filing of documents referred to by a party; or if observations are required on amendments which are merely of a minor character – two months; (ii) communications from an examining or opposition division raising matters of substance – four months; (iii) communications from the Legal Division – two months. Where a communication according to Art. 94(3) in examination is accompanied by a request for a translation of a priority document (Rule 53(3)), the period set for reply to that communication and for providing the translation is the same and is at least four months, regardless of the severity of the objections raised in the communication according to Art. 94(3) (see also A-III, 6.8.2). A longer time limit of up to six months is set only in the exceptional cases where it is clear that in the circumstances a four-month time limit cannot be adhered to. Each case must be judged on its individual merits and it is difficult to give general guidance, but a six-month time limit might be justified if for example the subject-matter of the application or patent or the objections raised are exceptionally complicated. Note that in this case an extension of the time limit (i.e. beyond six months) will be allowed only in exceptional cases (E-VIII, 1.6). Where the applicant is invited to submit the indication provided for in Rule 70(2), a six-month time limit running from the publication of the search report is appropriate."

This does not restore any loss of rights resulting from a time limit having already expired before the loss of priority date. For example, if a request for restoration of a priority right is filed upon entry into the European phase on expiry of the 31-month time limit under Rule 159(1) but the request is not granted resulting in the loss of the right of priority, the 31- month time limit will not be deferred.

The request must be submitted in writing before expiry of the period that has been set. The extended period is to be calculated from the start of the original period. In opposition proceedings, requests to extend time limits over and above the normal period of four months, both for communications from an opposition division raising matters of substance and communications issued by the formalities officer, or two months for communications requesting an act of a merely formal or minor character (E-VIII, 1.2), will only be granted in exceptional, duly substantiated cases. For a communication under Art. 101(1) and Rule 79 or Rule 81(2) and Rule 81(3), all parties to the proceedings can request an extension irrespective of whether they were invited in the communication to reply: if the extension is, exceptionally, granted to one of the parties, it automatically applies to all other parties. In other proceedings, a request for extension, even if filed without reasons, is normally allowed if it is for not more than two months and the total period set does not thereby exceed six months. A request for a longer extension, especially if the total period set exceeds six months, is allowed only exceptionally, when the reasons given are sufficient to show convincingly that a reply in the period previously set will not be possible. Such exceptional circumstances might be e.g. the fact that representatives or clients are so seriously ill that they cannot deal with the case in time; or the need to perform extensive biological experiments or tests. On the other hand, foreseeable or avoidable circumstances (e.g. leave, pressure of other work) are not accepted as a sufficiently exceptional circumstance (see Notice of the Vice-President of Directorate-General 2 of the EPO, OJ EPO 1989, 180). If the request for an extension is granted, the parties are informed of the new time limit. Otherwise, they are told that the relevant sanction has taken effect or will take effect. An application will be removed from the PACE programme (see E-VIII, 4) if the applicant has requested an extension of a time limit (OJ EPO 2015, A93, point A.4). In examination proceedings, failure to respond to a communication according to Art. 94(3) results in deemed withdrawal of the application (see E-VIII, 1.8 and E-VIII, 1.9.2). If the request for extension of a time limit filed in good time has been rejected and any applicant considers this unjust, they can only overcome the ensuing loss of rights by requesting a decision under Rule 112(2) and/or further processing under Art. 121(1) and Rule 135(1) (see E-VIII, 2), as applicable. Where the reimbursement of the fee for further processing is requested and this is rejected, such decision is open to appeal, either together with the final decision or separately, as the case may be (see J 37/89). The failure of a party to reply to a communication from the opposition division within the period set does not lead directly to any legal consequence. Rather, the opposition proceedings will proceed to the next stage, and this could be a decision under Art. 101(2) or (3)."

Equally, where an individual party can provide evidence of a dislocation of the delivery or transmission of mail due to an exceptional occurrence inside or outside EPC contracting states (such as, in particular, a natural disaster, war, civil disorder or a general breakdown of any of the means of electronic communication accepted by the EPO for the filing of documents), a late submission or payment will be deemed to be received in due time, provided that - the dislocation affected the locality where that party or their representative resides or has their principal place of business, - the dislocation existed on any of the last ten days of the period at issue, and - the transmission or payment is effected within five days from the end of the dislocation, together with - a formal request of the party concerned under Rule 134(5), accompanied by appropriate evidence. 1.6.2.3 Scope of application of Rule 134 An extension under Rule 134 applies to all periods under the EPC (see E-VIII, 1.1), including, in particular: - the time limits for the filing of submissions, e.g. replies to EPO communications; - the time limit under Rule 37(2) for the onward transmission to the EPO of applications filed with the central industrial property office of a contracting state (see A-II, 1.6); - the priority period under Art. 87(1) (see A-III, 6.6); - the opposition period under Art. 99(1); - the period for entry into the European phase under Rule 159(1); - the periods for the payment of fees (see A-X, 6.1), including, mutatis mutandis, the expiry of the period to pay renewal fees with an additional fee in accordance with Rule 51(2) and the expiry of the periods under Rule 51(3) and (4) (see A-X, 5.2.4). By contrast, an extension under Rule 134 does not affect: - the pendency of the earlier application when filing a divisional application (see A-IV, 1.1.1); - the beginning of the six-month period for the payment of a renewal fee with an additional fee under Rule 51(2) unless the due date for the renewal fee is deferred to the expiry of a period, for instance in the case of Rule 159(1)(g) (see A-X, 5.2.4); - the due date for the renewal fees for a divisional application and the beginning of the four-month period under Rule 51(3) (see A-IV, 1.4.3); - the date of the start of the search, which is relevant for the entitlement to a refund of the search fee (see A-X, 10.2.1); - the date of the start of substantive examination, which is relevant for filing a PPH request (see E-VIII, 4.3) or the entitlement to a refund of the examination fee (see A-VI, 2.5); - the date on which a request under Rule 22 (registration of transfers) or Rule 54 (certified priority document) is deemed to be filed, where the payment date is decisive, because these requests are deemed to have been filed only when the corresponding administrative fee has been paid. The extension equally does not affect the final date for making written submissions in preparation for oral proceedings under Rule 116, strictly speaking. However, a general dislocation in the delivery of mail or other exceptional occurrence under Rule 134(5) will be taken into account by an examining or opposition division in exercising its discretion whether to admit submissions filed after the date set under Rule 116 (see E-III, 8.5, sub-item (iv)). Given that the date fixed under Rule 116 is meant to ensure adequate preparation of the oral proceedings, a party making submissions after that date must show that it has taken reasonable efforts to do so as early as reasonably possible."

            "content": " If several acts have the same legal basis, they form a unitary procedural act and are subject to a unitary time limit (see J 26/95). Further processing in respect of such a time limit is subject to the payment of a single fee for further processing. The amount of the single fee depends on the number and character of the omitted acts forming the unitary procedural act. The following examples serve to illustrate this: - Requesting examination under Art. 94(1) in conjunction with Rule 70(1) requires filing a written request for examination and paying the examination fee. As both actions have the same legal basis, they form a unitary procedural act subject to a unitary time limit. If both actions were omitted, the single fee for further processing amounts to the sum of the flat fee and 50% of the examination fee (Art. 2(1), item 12, first and third indents, RFees). If only the examination fee was not paid in due time, the fee for further processing amounts to 50% of the examination fee (Art. 2(1), item 12, first indent, RFees). If only the written request for examination was omitted, the fee for further processing amounts to the flat fee (Art. 2(1), item 12, third indent, RFees). - The filing fee and the additional fee due if the application comprises more than 35 pages must be paid within the time limit set by Rule 38(1) and (2). As the additional fee is part of the filing fee, the payment of these two fees forms a unitary procedural act subject to a unitary time limit. Hence, one fee for further processing is due. If both fees were not paid in due time, the single fee for further processing comprises 50% of the filing fee and 50% of the additional fee (see Art. 2(1), item 12, first indent, RFees). If only one fee was not paid in due time, the single fee for further processing amounts to 50% of that omitted fee (see Art. 2(1), item 12, first indent, RFees). An exception to the above principle concerns Rule 71(3): - Approval of the text communicated under Rule 71(3) requires paying the fee for grant and publishing and, where applicable, claims fees (Rule 71(4)) and filing the translations of the claims within a four-month period (Rule 71(5)). As these actions have the same legal basis, they form a unitary procedural act subject to a unitary time limit. By way of exception to the principle that the single fee for further processing is computed on the basis of the number of omitted acts, Art. 2(1), item 12, second indent, RFees stipulates that only one flat fee for further processing is due in the event of late performance of any or all of the acts required under Rule 71(3), i.e. paying the fee for grant and publishing and filing the translations of the claims. If in addition claims fees were not paid in due time, the single fee for further processing amounts to the sum of the flat fee and 50% of the claims fees (see Art. 2(1), item 12, second and first indent, RFees). If only the claims fees were not paid in due time, the single fee for further processing amounts to 50% of the claims fees (Art. 2(1), item 12, first indent, RFees). For European patent applications filed before 1 April 2009 and international applications entering the European phase before that date, any page fees under Art. 2(2), item 7.2, RFees are part of the fee for grant and printing. Therefore, if only page fees were not paid in due time, the fee for further processing amounts to the flat fee (Art. 2(1), item 12, second indent, RFees). Actions not forming a unitary procedural act are subject to time limits expiring independently of one another, each resulting in the application being deemed withdrawn. If such time limits expire on the same date, the missing of each independent time limit results in the application being deemed withdrawn (see J 26/95). This applies regardless of whether the applicant is informed of the non-performance of procedural acts in one communication or in several communications. In such cases, a fee for further processing is due in respect of each unobserved time limit. For an example, see E-VIII, 3.1.3. A request for further processing may also be filed between expiry of the unobserved time limit and notification of the communication concerning either the failure to observe a time limit or a loss of rights. The department competent to decide on the omitted act also decides on the request for further processing. Where the omitted act is a substantive response (e.g. to the extended European search report or to a communication under Art. 94(3)), a mere procedural request (e.g. a request for oral proceedings) does not qualify as completion of the omitted act and therefore cannot lead to further processing being granted (see B-XI, 8 and C-IV, 3). As a general rule, further processing is the legal remedy for failure to observe a time limit during proceedings before grant, even where the consequence is a partial loss of rights (e.g. loss of priority right). However, the possibility of requesting further processing is ruled out for the periods referred to in Art. 121(4) and Rules 6(1), 16(1)(a), 31(2), 36(2), 40(3), 51(2) to (5), 52(2) and (3), 55, 56, 56a(1) and (3) to (7), 58, 59, 62a, 63, 64, 112(2) and 164(1) and (2)."

This means, for example, that in opposition proceedings there can be no re-establishment of rights in respect of the time limits for the patent proprietor's submission of observations on the written statements of the other parties to the proceedings or on communications from the opposition division. Likewise, there can be no re-establishment of rights in case of failure to observe the time limit for the payment of the renewal fees under Rule 51(1) as valid payment is still possible under Rule 51(2). Re-establishment of rights is ruled out in respect of all periods for which further processing is available and in respect of the period for requesting re-establishment of rights. This means that re-establishment of rights comes into play where further processing is excluded in respect of a specific period or where the time limit for requesting further processing has expired. In the latter case, re-establishment of rights in respect of the time limit for requesting further processing is to be requested (see E-VIII, 2), and not in respect of the originally missed time limit. A \"time limit\" is taken to mean a specific period of time within which an act vis-à-vis the EPO must be completed (see E-VIII, 1.1). Re-establishment of rights is therefore not admissible e.g. in respect of failure to be present on the date of appointed oral proceedings. The following are examples of cases where re-establishment of rights may be requested. They concern the time limits for: - payment of a renewal fee plus additional fee; - requesting further processing in respect of the time limit for replying to a communication from the examining division under Art. 94(3); - filing the translation of any amended claims in opposition proceedings; - filing the request for a decision by the opposition division on the awarding of costs; - filing notice of appeal and/or grounds of appeal; and - filing a petition for review by the Enlarged Board of Appeal."

However, an opponent who has filed an appeal can request re-establishment of rights in respect of the time limit for submitting the grounds for appeal (see G 1/86). Where re-establishment of rights is requested by the patent proprietor in respect of a time limit connected with the opposition procedure, the opponents are party to the re-establishment proceedings (see T 552/02 and T 1561/05).

The omitted act must be completed within this period. Where the \"cause of non-compliance with the time limit\" involved some error in the carrying out of the party's intention to comply with the time limit, the removal of the cause of non-compliance occurs on the date on which the person responsible for the application is made aware of the fact that a time limit has not been observed or ought to have noticed the error if all due care had been taken. The removal of the cause of non-compliance is a matter of fact which has to be determined in the circumstances of each individual case. In the absence of circumstances to the contrary, where a communication under Rule 112(1) has been duly sent, it may be assumed that the removal was effected by receipt of this communication (see J 27/90). Unlike the time limit for other cases as described above, a request for re-establishment in respect of the priority period (Art. 87(1)) or the period for filing a petition for review by the Enlarged Board of Appeal (Art. 112a(4)) must be filed within two months of expiry of the relevant period. A request for re-establishment is not deemed to be filed until after the fee for the re-establishment of rights has been paid. The principles regarding unitary and independent procedural acts described in E-VIII, 2 apply mutatis mutandis to establishing the number of requests for re-establishment of rights, in particular for establishing the relevant fees to be paid. Where one unitary procedural act is omitted by not performing one or more actions forming that act, only one fee for re-establishment is due. Where several independent procedural acts are omitted, each resulting in the application being deemed withdrawn, a fee for re-establishment is due for each omitted act. These principles also apply to cases where re-establishment of rights must be requested in respect of the time limit(s) for requesting further processing (see Rule 136(3)). In such cases, the number of unobserved time limits, each resulting in the application being deemed withdrawn and requiring a request for further processing, determines the number of requests for re-establishment and the corresponding number of fees for re-establishment. Example 1 An international application comprises more than 35 pages and was published in a language other than an official language of the EPO. The acts required for entry into the European phase upon expiry of the 31-month period under Rule 159(1) were omitted. Due to their different legal nature, the individual acts required under Rule 159(1) do not form a unitary procedural step but are legally independent and subject to independent time limits. The table below provides a schematic illustration regarding further processing and re-establishment of rights (for information on the remedies available for non-observance of the time limits under Rule 159(1), see the individual sections under E-IX, 2). Box I of the table lists the number of independent unobserved time limits. Box II indicates the fee for further processing corresponding to each unobserved time limit. Box III provides the fee for re-establishment corresponding to each unobserved time limit. In the example, for a request for further processing to be allowed, completion of the omitted acts (i.e. all acts that were to be performed within the 31-month period) and payment of five fees for further processing (two of which comprise two fees) are required within the two-month period under Rule 135(1). If that period is missed, the applicant may request re-establishment of rights in respect of the period. The request requires completion of the omitted acts and payment of the corresponding number of fees for re-establishment of rights within the period under Rule 136(1). The omitted acts are those that were to be performed within the 31-month period and payment of the corresponding five fees for further processing. Payment of five fees for re-establishment of rights corresponds to the number of five independent fees for further processing. Omitted acts Time limits missed (box I) Number of fees for further processing (box II) Number of fees for re- establishment (box III) Filing of the translation 1 1 1 Payment of the filing fee 1 (unitary) 1 (comprising 50% of the filing fee and 50% of the additional fee) 1 Payment of the additional fee for an application comprising more than 35 pages Payment of the designation fee 1 1 1 Payment of the search fee 1 1 1 Filing of the request for examination 1 (unitary) 1 (comprising a flat fee and 50% of the examination fee) 1 Payment of the examination fee Resulting number of fees to be paid 5 non- observed time limits 5 fees for further processing, 2 of them comprising 2 fees 5 fees for re- establishment Example 2 The applicant missed the time limit for requesting further processing in respect of the time limit for replying to a communication from the examining division under Art. 94(3) as well as the time limit to pay the renewal fee with the additional fee. As these time limits expire independently of one another and both have been missed by the applicant, each resulting in the application being deemed withdrawn, a request for re-establishment has to be filed in respect of each unobserved time limit (J 26/95). In such cases, a fee for re-establishment has to be paid in respect of each request. In the case of independent time limits, in particular where they expire on different dates, the reasons for missing them and the date of removal of the cause of non-compliance may be different. Example 3 After a decision to refuse by the examining division, the applicant missed both the time limit for filing the notice and the time limit for filing the statement of grounds of appeal. Both time limits were missed for the same reason. Despite two time limits being missed, only one re-establishment fee has to be paid as both periods were triggered by the same event, i.e. the notification of the decision, and both time limits were missed on the same grounds. In such a case, re-establishment in respect of both periods has to be examined together and, as the result would inevitably be the same in both cases, one re-establishment fee is considered to be sufficient. If the time limits for filing the notice and the grounds were missed for different reasons, there would be no causal connection and two fees for re-establishment would have to be paid."

The obligation to exercise due care must be considered in the light of the situation as it stood before the missed time limit expired. \"All due care\" means all reasonable care, i.e. the standard of care that the notional reasonably competent patentee, applicant or representative would employ in all the relevant circumstances (see T 30/90). For cases where the cause of non-compliance with a time limit involves some error in the carrying out of the party's intention to comply with the time limit, all due care is considered to have been taken if non-compliance with the time limit results either from exceptional circumstances or from an isolated mistake within a normally satisfactory monitoring system. A finding of exceptional circumstances justifying the re-establishment of rights is dependent on the individual facts of the case. Examples include inter alia organisational upheavals and sudden serious illnesses. In such cases, the requesters must show not only the existence of those circumstances, but also that they took all due care, e.g. by carefully preparing the reorganisation or by having an effective staff substitution system. Where an isolated mistake within a normally satisfactory monitoring system is alleged, the relevant party must show that the monitoring system normally works well. Such a system must include an independent, effective cross-check mechanism. However, this requirement does not apply to relatively small entities/patent departments (see T 166/87 and J 11/03). The duty to exercise all due care applies first and foremost to the applicants and then, by virtue of delegation, to the representative duly entrusted by the applicant to act on their behalf in prosecuting the application (see J 3/93). The obligations of the applicant and those of their representative are clearly distinct and depend on the relationship between them (see T 112/89 and J 19/04). In this regard, the scope of the mandate and any express instructions given to the representative are taken into account. Applicants are entitled to rely on their representative. To the extent that applicants are on notice that instructions are required in order to meet a time limit, they have however a duty to take all due care in the circumstances to meet the time limit (see T 381/93). The fact that the professional representative has acted correctly does not exempt applicants from suffering the consequences of their own mistakes or negligence. European representatives are responsible in the procedure before the EPO and must be presumed to be supervising their own work continuously (see T 1095/06). When professional representatives have been instructed by their client to perform a particular procedural action and do not receive in due time the necessary additional instructions or required means, they must in principle take all necessary measures to try to obtain these instructions from their client and ascertain their true wishes (see T 112/89 and J 19/04). Professional representatives can delegate routine tasks, such as typing, posting letters, noting time limits or checking due dates, to assistants. In those cases, the same strict standard of care is not expected of the assistant as is demanded of the representative himself. The representative must however show that the assistants have been carefully selected, duly instructed and periodically supervised (see J 5/80 and T 439/06). If the applicants entrust a further party with taking care of their application matters, e.g. a non-European representative or a fee payment agency, it has to be established that such a party has taken the due care required of an applicant for or proprietor of a European patent (see J 3/88). In particular, a non-European representative must also show that a reliable system for the monitoring of time limits was in place when the time limit was missed (see J 4/07)."

The grounds for the decision need only be stated if the request is not granted, except in opposition proceedings, as opponents are party to the re-establishment proceedings (see E-VIII, 3.1.2). The department which took the contested decision will have to consider re-establishment of rights in respect of an unobserved time limit for appeal when the conditions for granting interlocutory revision are fulfilled (see E-XII, 7). It can, however, only decide to allow re-establishment if it can do so within the three-month time limit of Art. 109(2) and the conditions for re-establishment (see E-VIII, 3.1.1 to E-VIII, 3.1.4) are fulfilled. In all other cases, the appeal, together with the application for the re-establishment of rights, must be submitted to the competent board of appeal. If the request is granted, the legal consequences of the failure to observe the time limit will be deemed not to have ensued. Any renewal fees which may have fallen due between the expiry of the missed time limit and the notification of the decision to grant the request for re-establishment will be due on that latter date. Valid payment will still be possible within four months of that date. If a renewal fee was already due when the loss of rights occurred but could still be paid under Rule 51(2), it may still be paid within six months of the date of notification of the decision re-establishing the rights, provided that the additional fee is also paid within that period. If other time limits the non-observance of which would also lead to a loss of rights were already running when the loss of rights occurred, on granting the request for re-establishment the EPO will send the applicant a communication triggering those time limits anew."

If an applicant enters the European phase without having requested international preliminary examination under PCT Chapter II, the EPO will act as a \"designated Office\". If before entering the European phase the application was processed under PCT Chapter II, the EPO will act in the European phase as an ''elected Office''. Pursuant to Art. 153(2), an international application for which the EPO is a designated or elected Office is deemed to be a European patent application. In addition to being a designated and, where appropriate, elected Office, the EPO may act as a receiving Office under the PCT within the terms set out in Art. 151. It may also act as an International Searching Authority (ISA), as an International Preliminary Examining Authority (IPEA) under the terms of Art. 152 and/or as an International Searching Authority specified for Supplementary International Search (SISA) under the PCT (see also the EPO-WIPO Agreement, OJ EPO 2017, A115, OJ EPO 2018, A24, and OJ EPO 2018, A35). There are thus the following possibilities for a European application filed under the provisions of the PCT: (i) the filing of the application and the international search take place at an office or offices other than the EPO (e.g. the Japan Patent Office). The EPO is a designated Office; (ii) the application is filed at another office (e.g. the United Kingdom Patent Office) but the EPO performs the international search. The EPO acts as International Searching Authority and is a designated Office; (iii) the application is filed at the EPO, which also performs the international search. The EPO acts as receiving Office, International Searching Authority and designated Office; (iv) in the cases mentioned under (i) - (iii), the applicant files, in addition, a demand for international preliminary examination with an IPEA other than the EPO. The EPO is an \"elected Office\"; (v) in the cases mentioned under (i) - (iii), the applicant files, in addition, a demand for international preliminary examination with the EPO as International Preliminary Examining Authority. The EPO may carry out this function irrespective of whether it was the receiving Office. It can, however, only act as an IPEA if the international search was carried out by the EPO, the Austrian, Spanish, Swedish, Finnish or Turkish Patent Office, the Nordic Patent Institute or the Visegrad Patent Institute. The EPO thus acts as IPEA and is also an elected Office; (vi) if the international search has been carried out by an office other than the EPO, the applicant may still request the EPO to perform a supplementary international search (SIS) in its capacity as SISA. In case (i), there will be an international search report drawn up by another office. In cases (ii) and (iii), the international search report and the \"written opinion of the International Searching Authority\" (WO-ISA) (Rule 43bis PCT) will have been prepared by the search division of the EPO. For further details on the procedure before the EPO as RO, ISA, IPEA or SISA, see the Guidelines for search and examination at the EPO as PCT authority (GL/PCT-EPO) and the Guide for applicants: \"'Euro-PCT Guide': PCT procedure at the EPO\"."

Where an international application was filed and published in the international phase in an official language of the EPO, it is not possible to change the language of the proceedings on entry into the European phase by filing a translation of that application into either of the other two official languages of the EPO (see G 4/08). In such cases, the language of the proceedings within the meaning of Art. 14(3) remains the language in which the application was published by WIPO's International Bureau. A translation, whether filed on entry into the European phase under Art. 153(4) or in the international phase under Rule 12.3 or 12.4 PCT, may always be brought into conformity with the application as filed. The conditions set out in A-VII, 7 apply."

The PCT requirements corresponding to those of A-II, 2 (\"Persons entitled to file an application\") are more restrictive, as in general the applicant must be a resident or national of a PCT contracting state and therefore no further examination as regards entitlement is necessary. The instructions in A-II, 3 (\"Procedure on filing\") do not apply. The provisions for late filing of missing parts (Rule 56) or correction of erroneously filed application documents or parts (Rule 56a) completely contained in the priority document apply if the EPO is designated/elected Office. Similar options exist under the PCT in relation to the receiving Office (Rule 20.5 to 20.8 PCT). These sets of provisions apply in parallel. For a request under Rule 56 or Rule 56a to be allowed by the EPO as designated/elected Office, it must have been filed, together with the documents required under Rule 56(3) or Rule 56a(4) respectively, within two months from the date of filing or from a communication of the receiving Office under Rule 20.5(a) PCT or Rule 20.5bis(a) PCT, as the case may be (see Rule 56(2) and Rule 56a(3)), and the applicant must have effectively requested \"early processing\" under Art. 23(2) PCT (see E-IX, 2.8) before expiry of the two-month period under Rule 56(2) or Rule 56a(3). Incorporations by reference by the receiving Office under Rule 20.5bis(d) PCT, i.e. without changing the filing date, will be effective before the EPO as designated or elected Office for international applications filed on or after 1 November 2022 (see C-III, 1.3). For details see the notice from the EPO dated 23 June 2022, OJ EPO 2022, A71. On entry into the European phase, the normal procedures apply on the basis that the correct and erroneously filed parts are thus considered part of the application as filed. In addition, Art. 26, 27 and 48 PCT, Rules 82bis and 82ter PCT and Rule 139 EPC apply. The date of filing (see A-II, 4 (\"Examination on filing\")) of a Euro-PCT application is that accorded under the PCT by the PCT authority which acted as the receiving Office unless correction as a consequence of review by the EPO as designated/elected Office under Art. 24 or 25 PCT or Rule 82ter PCT applies (see E-IX, 2.9). In respect of the procedure for establishing the date of filing in the case of elements or parts erroneously filed under Rule 20.5bis(d) PCT, see C-III, 1.3. The formalities examination upon entry into the European phase encompasses all checks required to verify that the requirements of Rules 159 and 163 have been met. If the application is not deemed to be withdrawn, a copy of the application is referred to the search division for drawing up any supplementary European search report, if necessary (see E-IX, 3.1)."

An agent having a right to practise before the PCT International Authorities is not necessarily authorised to act before the EPO (see Art. 27(7) PCT). If the agents acting in the international phase are professional representatives entitled to practise before the EPO, such representatives are not automatically considered appointed for the European phase. If any applicant has mandated them to act on their behalf also in the European phase, the representatives need to identify themselves accordingly to the EPO as designated/elected Office. The only case in which professional representatives acting in the international phase are automatically considered appointed for the European phase is if they were validly appointed in the procedure before the EPO as receiving Office, ISA or IPEA and it is clear from the respective file that the appointment extends to representation in the European phase. The same principles apply where applicants having their residence or principal place of business in an EPC contracting state are represented by an authorised employee (see A-VIII, 1.3). Applicants, in particular those not resident in an EPC contracting state, are recommended to appoint a professional representative before the EPO in good time, i.e. before initiating proceedings before the EPO as designated/elected Office (see also E-IX, 2.1.2). However, up to expiry of the 31-month time limit under Rule 159, applicants having neither a residence nor their principal place of business within the territory of one of the contracting states may either comply with any requirement themselves or act through a professional representative entitled to practise before the EPO. This means that applicants having neither a residence nor the principal place of business within the territory of one of the contracting states may themselves , within the 31-month time limit, for example sign and file EPO Form 1200, submit amendments, file a translation of the application, file a request for early processing, etc. Applicants having neither a residence nor their principal place of business within the territory of one of the contracting states who do not themselves take the required steps for entry into the European phase within the 31-month time limit may, after expiry of that time limit, perform these and the other procedural steps (e.g. filing a request for re-establishment of rights) only through a professional representative entitled to practise before the EPO. In case of failure to appoint a professional representative where this is required, the EPO invites the applicant to do so within a time limit of two months. Until the EPO is informed of a (valid) appointment, any procedural step taken by the applicant will be deemed not to have been taken. If the deficiency is not corrected in due time, the application will be refused; the applicant may request further processing (see E-VIII, 2). If there is more than one applicant and the following information was not provided for one or more of those applicants in the international phase and is still missing at the expiry of the 31-month time limit under Rule 159(1): (i) address (ii) nationality (iii) state of residence or principal place of business the EPO will invite the applicant to furnish these indications within two months. Failure to do so will lead to refusal of the application. The same applies if the requirements for representation are not met at the end of the 31-month time limit, with the same consequence for failure to correct the deficiency in time. If the applicants fail to reply in time to the above-mentioned invitation, they may request further processing. Applicants (whether natural or legal persons) whose residence or principal place of business is in an EPC contracting state and who act without a professional representative may make use of an address for correspondence which is different from their address of residence.

In accordance with Rule 17.2 PCT, the International Bureau will be requested by the EPO to furnish it with a copy as standard practice promptly, but not earlier than international publication, or, where the applicant has requested early processing (in accordance with Art. 23(2) PCT), not earlier than the date of the request. Where the applicant has complied with Rule 17.1(a), (b) or (b-bis) PCT, the EPO may not ask the applicant himself to furnish a copy. Where the file number or the copy of the previous application has not yet been submitted at the expiry of the 31-month time limit, the EPO invites the applicant to furnish the number or the copy within two months. However, Rule 53(2) and the decision of the President of the EPO dated 18 October 2018, OJ EPO 2018, A78, providing an exception to the requirement that a copy of the previous application be furnished (see A-III, 6.7), also apply to international applications entering the European phase. Furthermore, where the applicant has complied with Rule 17.1(a), (b) or (b-bis) PCT the EPO as a designated Office may not ask the applicant himself to furnish it with a copy of the priority document (Rule 17.2(a) PCT, second sentence). If the priority document is not on file, substantive examination may nevertheless be started, provided that neither intermediate documents (published in the priority period) nor Art. 54(3) documents exist which cause the patentability of the subject-matter claimed to depend on the validity of the priority right. However, no European patent may be granted until such time as the priority document is on file. In such a case, the applicant is informed that the decision to grant will not be taken as long as the priority document is missing. On the other hand, the application may be refused without the priority document being on file, provided that the relevant prior art is neither an intermediate document nor an Art. 54(3) document, the relevance of which depends on the validity of the priority right. For more details on treatment of such cases in examination see F-VI, 3.4. Where a translation of the previous application into one of the official languages of the EPO is required, it must be filed on request from the EPO in accordance with Rule 53(3) (see A-III, 6.8 and subsections and 6.10). 2.3.5.2 Information on prior art The applicant must, on entry into the European phase, file the results of any search carried out by or on behalf of the office of first filing for each application whose priority is claimed (see A-III, 6.12). 2.3.5.3 Restoration of priority The provisions for restoration of priority right (see A-III, 6.6) also exist under the PCT (Rules 26bis.3 and 49ter PCT). Under the PCT, restoration of the right of priority can be made either in the international phase before the receiving Office (Rule 26bis.3 PCT) or upon entry into the European phase before the EPO as designated or elected Office (Rule 49ter.2(b)(i) PCT). The EPO only applies the \"due care\" criterion in accordance with its practice under Art. 122 (Rules 26bis.3(a)(i) and 49ter.2(a)(i) PCT; see also E-VIII, 3.2 and the notice from the EPO dated 7 November 2007, OJ EPO 2007, 692). As a consequence, any request for restoration of priority rights granted by a receiving Office under the \"unintentional\" criterion does not have any effect before the EPO as designated/elected Office (Rule 49ter.1(b) PCT). As set out hereafter, if the applicant has already filed a request for restoration of priority with the receiving Office, a (new) request need not always be filed upon entry into the European phase. If the priority right was restored by the receiving Office under the \"due care criterion\", no new request need be filed with the EPO as designated/elected Office, since the EPO will, in principle, recognise the decision of the receiving Office. If, however, the EPO has reasonable doubt that the requirements for grant were met, it will notify the applicant accordingly. In this communication the reasons for such doubt will be indicated and a time limit will be set within which the applicant may submit comments. Consequently, if the applicant wants the priority claim to be valid in the procedure before the EPO as designated/elected Office, a request for restoration must always be filed if, in the procedure before the receiving Office: - no request for restoration of priority right was filed; - a request for restoration of priority right was rejected; - a request for restoration of priority right was granted under the \"unintentional criterion\". The EPO as designated/elected Office will grant a request for restoration of priority right only if the following requirements are met: (i) the filing date is within two months of the date of expiry of the priority period; (ii) the failure to claim the right of priority within the priority period occurred in spite of due care required by the circumstances having been taken; (iii) a request for restoration of priority is filed within one month from the date on which the 31-month time limit for entry into the European phase expired or from the effective date of early entry into the European phase (see E-IX, 2.8); where the application is deemed withdrawn under Rule 160(1) for failure to comply with a requirement under Rule 159(1), the request for restoration of priority may still be filed together with a timely request for further processing in respect of the 31-month time limit under Rule 159(1) or, failing this, with a timely request for re-establishment of rights in respect of the period for requesting further processing; (iv) the fee for restoration of priority (Art. 2(1), item 13, RFees) is duly paid within the time limit mentioned under point (iii); the further considerations made under point (iii) also apply to this fee; (v) the request is accompanied by a statement of reasons for the failure to file the international application within the priority period and is preferably accompanied by any declaration or other evidence in support of the statement of reasons."

If they have not been paid by then, under Rule 162(2), they may still be paid within the six-month period under Rule 161(1) and (2). Rule 162(2) distinguishes between two situations in which the applicant must ensure payment of claims fees before expiry of the six-month period: Rule 162(2), first sentence, covers the situation in which the applicant does not file amendments after expiry of the 31-month period and before expiry of the six-month period under Rule 161. In this case, the applicant must ensure that any claims fees not yet paid for the set of claims filed within the 31-month period are paid before expiry of the six-month period under Rule 161. Example: A Euro-PCT application X contains 27 claims on expiry of the 31-month period. The applicants pay five claims fees within the 31-month period. They must ensure that seven claims fees are paid before expiry of the six-month period under Rule 161. Rule 162(2), second sentence, covers the situation in which the applicants file an amended set of claims after expiry of the 31-month period and before expiry of the six-month period under Rule 161. In this case, they must compute the number of claims fees due on the basis of the claims on file on expiry of the six-month period under Rule 161. Before expiry of this period, they must ensure that any claims fees are paid for the number of claims on file on expiry of this period which exceeds the number of claims for which claims fees were paid within the 31-month period. Example: A Euro-PCT application Y contains 27 claims on expiry of the 31-month period. The applicants pay five claims fees within the 31-month period. After expiry of the 31-month period and before expiry of the six-month period under Rule 161, they file an amended set of 32 claims. The applicants must compute the number of claims fees on the basis of the claims on file on expiry of the six-month period, i.e. 32 - 15 = 17. Since they have already paid five claims fees, they must pay 12 claims fees (17 - 5 = 12) before expiry of the six-month period under Rule 161. If there are more than 15 claims on file on expiry of the six-month period under Rule 161, any of the sixteenth and each subsequent claim for which no claims fee has been paid is deemed to be abandoned under Rule 162(4) (see also the notice from the EPO dated 16 December 2016, OJ EPO 2016, A103). Where a claims fee is not paid in due time, the claim concerned shall be deemed to be abandoned. The loss of rights may be remedied by a request for further processing (see E-VIII, 2). Features of a claim deemed to have been abandoned pursuant to Rule 162(4) and which are not otherwise to be found in the description or drawings cannot subsequently be reintroduced into the application and, in particular, into the claims."

The EPO will publish the translation of the application submitted by the applicant upon entry into the European phase. In that case the provisional protection is, subject to Art. 67(2) and (3), only effective as from the date of publication of the translation by the EPO. The translation of the international application is published together with the bibliographic data as an A document and includes all documents that were part of the international publication as originally published: - the description as originally filed; - the claims as originally filed; - any claims amended under Art. 19 PCT, including any related statement of which a translation has been filed (see E-IX, 2.1.3, items (viii) and (ix)); - any drawings as originally filed; - the sequence listing forming part of the description; - the abstract; - any appendices to the application; - any certificate(s) of the deposit of biological material; - the translation of the international search report (Rule 44bis.3 PCT). The mandatory translation of the annexes to the IPER and any amendments to the application documents filed on or after entry into the European phase are not published. If Rule 20.5bis(d) PCT applies (see C-III, 1.3), the publication will comprise the translation of both the erroneously filed application documents and the correct application documents.

The notification of incompatibility was withdrawn with effect from 1 November 2022 and is no longer indicated for applications filed on or after that date. Pursuant to Art. 153(6), the international search report takes the place of the European search report. Once the supplementary European search report has been drawn up, this will be mentioned in the European Patent Bulletin. The supplementary search report itself is not published but is available via file inspection (see A-XI, 2.2). If the translation is not supplied, the application is to be deemed withdrawn (see E-IX, 2.1.3).

However, the EPO may, on the express request of the applicant, process or examine an international application at any time (Art. 23(2) PCT). If the International Bureau (IB) has not yet transmitted to the EPO a copy of the international application, the ISR and the WO-ISA, the applicant may but does not have to file with the IB a request to do so. If necessary, the EPO will take care of this itself. A request for early processing under Art. 23(2) or 40(2) PCT may be filed with the EPO at any time before expiry of the 31-month time limit (Art. 22(3) PCT and Rule 159(1)). The request does not require a specific wording, but applicants must clearly express that they wish the processing of their application before the EPO as designated/elected Office to commence early. Applicants using EPO Form 1200 may file a request by ticking a check box in section 12.1 (see the notice from the EPO dated 7 July 2017, OJ EPO 2017, A74). For the request to be effective, applicants must comply with the requirements stipulated in Rule 159(1) as if the 31-month time limit expired on the date they request early processing, i.e.: payment of the filing fee (including any additional fee under Art. 2(1), item 1a, RFees if the application comprises more than 35 pages), filing of a translation (if a translation is required under Art. 153(4)), specification of the application documents, and payment of the search fee (where a supplementary European search report has to be drawn up under Art. 153(7)). Which further requirements stipulated in Rule 159(1) must be complied with depends on the date on which early processing is requested, since the (regular) time limits for paying the designation fee (Rule 39(1)) and the renewal fee (Rule 51(1)) and for filing the request for examination and paying the examination fee (Rule 70(1)) may not have expired on the date the request for early processing is filed. Therefore, if any of these time limits is still running on that date (or, in the case of the renewal fee, if the due date according to Rule 51(1) is later than that date), the request for early processing will be effective without the requirement(s) concerned having been complied with (Art. 153(2), Art. 11(3) PCT). If applicants wish not only the processing of the application before the EPO as designated/elected Office but also the examination of the application to start, they must have filed a valid request for examination (including payment of the examination fee), even if the time limit under Rule 70(1) has not yet expired at the date of effective entry into the European phase, since examination will be taken up only if a request for examination has been validly filed (see E-IX, 2.5.2). Furthermore, if a request for examination is filed before the EPO has, where applicable, sent the supplementary European search report to the applicants, examination will start only upon receipt of an indication from them that they wish to proceed further with the application and, if required, a response to the extended European search report (see E-IX, 2.5.3). For international applications filed between 1 July 2020 and 31 October 2022, correction of erroneously filed elements or parts under Rule 20.5bis(d) PCT by the receiving Office is not effective in proceedings before the EPO as designated/elected Office in accordance with the EPO's declaration of incompatibility (Rule 20.8 PCT). Thus, applicants who want to make use of the abridged procedure (by requesting that the correct application documents be disregarded or by indicating that they wish to pursue the application containing the correct application documents with the date of receipt of those application documents as the filing date – see C-III, 1.3) must inform the EPO accordingly at the time the request for early processing is validly filed or at the latest before the communication under Rules 20.8(c) and 82ter.1(c) and (d) PCT is issued. The automatic debiting procedure may be used for effecting payment of the fees falling due on filing the request (see Annex A.1 and Annex A.2 to the ADA, Supplementary publication 3, OJ EPO 2022). However, automatic debiting can only be performed if the EPO can establish whether or not a page fee needs to be included as part of the filing fee (see A-III, 13.2). This is only possible if the EPO has access to the documents referred to in Art. 20 PCT, i.e. if: - the international application has already been published at the time the request for early processing is received, - the EPO is the receiving Office, or - the EPO is acting as (S)ISA or IPEA. If none of the above documents is available to the EPO on the day the request for early processing is filed, applicants are advised to choose another means of payment. Otherwise the fees due will be debited on the date of receipt of the documents referred to in Art. 20 PCT from the International Bureau (Rule 47.4 PCT) and the date on which the request for early processing takes effect will be postponed to that date. If pursuant to Rule 159(1)(h) a certificate of exhibition must be filed and this requirement is not met, this will not prevent the request for early processing from being effective, but it will affect the prior art that the EPO takes into account in the European phase. If on the date the request for early processing is filed any necessary requirement is not complied with, the request will be effective only as from the date on which all necessary requirements have been complied with. If on the date the request for early processing is filed all necessary requirements for entry into the European phase are complied with, the request is effective and the Euro-PCT application will as from that date be processed in the same way as a Euro-PCT application which has entered the European phase by fulfilling the necessary requirements of Rule 159(1) within the 31-month time limit and without a request for early processing having been filed. On that date the international phase is thus terminated in respect of the EPO as designated/elected Office (J 18/09, Reasons 13). Moreover, since by filing an effective request for early processing the processing ban is lifted, as from that date it is no longer possible to claim the 31-month time limit under Rule 159(1). For details see the notice from the EPO dated 21 February 2013, OJ EPO 2013, 156."

Further, if a receiving Office accords the international filing date on the basis of incorporation by reference of missing parts under Rule 20.5 PCT, the EPO as designated/elected Office will review of its own motion whether the requirements of Rule 82ter.1(b)(i)-(iii) PCT have been complied with. In particular, the EPO will consider whether the element or part incorporated by reference was indeed missing. For instance, where the international application contained a description and a claim or claims on the international filing date, it is not possible to replace these elements with elements from a priority application. It is also not possible to add elements from a priority application if this would result in the international application having, for instance, two (or more) descriptions or two (or more) sets of claims. As of 1 July 2020, such cases may however be handled by the receiving Office under Rule 20.5bis PCT (see E-IX, 2.9.4 for the determination of the filing date in such a case).

In the case of missing parts, the applicant may also request that the missing part concerned be disregarded in the European patent grant procedure.

In these cases, a written opinion of the ISA (WO-ISA) or a supplementary international search report (SISR) with explanations under Rule 45bis.7(e) PCT and – if the EPO was also IPEA – an international preliminary examination report (IPER) will already have been transmitted to the applicant during the international phase.

According to Art. 113(1), decisions of the EPO may only be based on grounds or evidence on which the parties concerned have had an opportunity to present their comments.

Moreover, as a rule, decisions will not be given until an internal EPO time limit (e.g. 20 days) following upon the official time limit (but from which the parties may derive no rights) has expired, so as to ensure that documents received at the end of the period officially allowed have actually been entered in the files when the decision is being taken and can be taken into account in the decision.

In individual cases, consideration may also be given to the reasoning of those decisions which merely meet the requests of the parties.

Amendments and arguments submitted by a party need to be considered, and the party must be given an opportunity to comment on the grounds and evidence brought forward by the examining division (see T 1123/04 and T 852/07). A document may not be cited for the first time in a decision (see T 635/04) unless it has been introduced during oral proceedings. The use of fresh arguments in a decision still based on grounds and evidence communicated beforehand is not precluded (see T 268/00 and T 1557/07). If a case is remitted from the boards of appeal for further prosecution, the examining division must check whether requests from examination proceedings prior to the appeal are still outstanding and must give the party an opportunity to comment (see T 1494/05). If the facts and grounds essential to a decision have been submitted by one party and if the party whose case is to be rejected has been afforded sufficient time to comment, the principle concerning the right to be heard set out in Art. 113(1) will have been respected. If the decision in opposition proceedings is to be based on grounds which were raised in the examination proceedings but not in the notice of opposition, the observations by the parties or the communications of the opposition division, these must be introduced (i.e. raised for discussion) by the opposition division in the opposition proceedings before the decision is given so as to afford the parties an opportunity to comment. If the opposition is based on lack of inventive step, the proprietor of the patent must expect that the prior art newly designated in the opposition proceedings will be considered in conjunction with the prior art described in the introductory part of an independent claim. However, if new facts and grounds are introduced during the proceedings or if the facts and grounds on which the envisaged decision is to be based were not stated so unambiguously and clearly in the written submissions of the parties as to give a party occasion to comment, the party concerned must be given an opportunity to submit an opinion and to produce evidence before the decision is given. A patent proprietor's right to be heard has not however been violated if, by making only minor amendments to the claims in response to a communication from the opposition division setting out the material arguments against maintaining the patent as it stands, the result is that the grounds for revoking the patent remain essentially unchanged, provided the proprietor's comments have been duly considered. In such a case, where the obstacles to maintenance have already been put to the proprietor and continue to apply, the patent may be revoked immediately, without any need to communicate again the full arguments on which the decision would be based."

Consequently, for example, an amended version proposed by the examining or opposition division (see C-V, 1.1, D-VI, 4.2 and 7.2.1) may only be adopted as a basis for the decision if it has been approved by the applicant or proprietor. In the case of one or more auxiliary requests directed to alternative texts for grant or maintenance of a patent, every such request qualifies as a text submitted or agreed by the applicant or proprietor within the meaning of Art. 113(2) (see T 234/86), and therefore must be dealt with in the order indicated or agreed to by the applicant or proprietor, up to and including the highest-ranking allowable request, if any. When considering such requests it is essential that they are treated in the correct order. Thus, for instance, if the only allowable request is an auxiliary request, but is accompanied by a higher auxiliary request for oral proceedings (e.g. a request that oral proceedings be held if the main request cannot be granted) then a communication under Rule 71(3) could not be issued on the basis of the allowable request, but instead oral proceedings in accordance with the higher request would have to be appointed, or a further communication under Rule 71(1) issued (see E-X, 2.9). If the order of the requests is not clear from the applicant's submissions, then it would be necessary to contact the applicant to clarify the situation before proceeding."

If, exceptionally, one or more division members cannot sign the decision, e.g. owing to extended illness, only a division member who was present at the oral proceedings (preferably the chair) may sign it on their behalf (see T 243/87). However, in such a situation, a brief written explanation as to why one member is signing on behalf of another must be provided (T 2348/19). A written decision signed by someone who did not take part in the oral proceedings at which the decision was pronounced is not legally valid (see T 390/86). The presentation of the facts and the submissions, the reasoning and the communication of the means of redress are generally omitted when a decision merely meets the requests of all the parties concerned; this applies in particular to the decision to grant, which is based on the documents that the applicant has approved (Rule 71(5)). The same applies when the patent is maintained in an amended form, because this is preceded by a final interlocutory decision pursuant to Art. 106(2) concerning the documents on which the maintenance of the patent is to be based (see D-VI, 7.2.2). The decision must be drafted using only the language of proceedings in order to meet the requirements of Rule 111(2).

For important general aspects relating to the reasoning of decisions, see the example below and E-X, 1.3.3. Example: Often an application lacking an inventive step also lacks clarity. The decision must clearly set whether the application is refused because the subject-matter of the claims is unclear and would also lack inventive step once clarified or whether it is refused because the subject-matter of the claims lacks inventive step and would have to be clarified once the inventive step objection is overcome. The reasoning for each of the grounds on which the decision is based must contain, in logical sequence, those arguments which justify the order. It must be complete and independently comprehensible, i.e. generally without references. If, however, a question has already been raised in detail in a particular communication contained in the file, the reasoning of the decision may be summarised accordingly and reference may be made to the relevant communication for the details. The conclusions drawn from the facts and evidence, e.g. publications, must be made clear. In particular, there must be consistency between the reasons and the facts as set out in the decision and in the minutes (also see E-X, 2.4). The parts of a publication which are important for the decision must be cited in such a way that those conclusions can be checked without difficulty. Therefore, reference is made to each particular passage in the publication. It is not sufficient, for example, merely to assert that the cited publications show that the subject of a claim is known or obvious, or, conversely, do not cast doubt on its patentability. The arguments put forward by the examiner during the proceedings form the \"skeleton\" for the decision and already define a complete and unbroken chain of reasoning leading to refusal. The decision may be based only on reasons already communicated to the applicant (Art. 113(1)). The applicant's arguments must be dealt with either point by point at the appropriate juncture in the chain of reasoning or en bloc at the end. The latter approach is often preferable as it makes clear that the final result is based solely on reasons already communicated to the applicant in compliance with Art. 113(1). In the part refuting the applicant's arguments, the decision must make clear why none of those arguments persuaded the examining division to depart from the final result. It is particularly important that special attention be paid to important facts and arguments which may speak against the decision made.

The need for complete and detailed reasoning is especially great when dealing with contentious points which are important for the decision; on the other hand, no unnecessary details or additional reasons need to be given which are intended to provide further proof of what has already been proven. The decision is a standalone document and must include the statement that the application is refused.

If one of the requests is allowable, the communication pursuant to Rule 71(3) is to be issued on the basis of the (first) allowable request and must be accompanied by a brief indication of the essential reasons why the higher-ranking requests are not allowable or not admissible (see C-V, 1.1). If the applicant, in response to the communication pursuant to Rule 71(3), maintains higher-ranking requests which are not allowable or not admissible, a decision to refuse the application pursuant to Art. 97(2) will normally be issued (see C-V, 4.7 and 4.6.2); the reasons must set out the grounds for the non-allowability or non-admissibility of each request which ranks higher than the allowable request. In respect of the allowable request, the decision to refuse must mention that applicants have failed to give their approval to it. Similarly, if in opposition proceedings the proprietor has submitted in addition to the main request one or more auxiliary requests, none of which is allowable, the patent must be revoked and the decision must set out, in respect of each request submitted and maintained by the proprietor, the reasons for not allowing it. Where one of the proprietor's requests directed to the maintenance of the patent in amended form is allowable, an interlocutory decision is to be issued on the basis of the (first) allowable request; it has to set out the reasons why this request meets the requirements of the EPC and, additionally, the reasons why the higher-ranking requests do not. In so far as a decision includes the rejection of any of the multiple requests, such decision may not be taken until the applicant or proprietor has been informed, with respect to each of these requests, of the reasons for not allowing them, so that the applicant or proprietor is not deprived of the opportunity to present comments (Art. 113(1) – right to be heard). Similarly, an opportunity to comment must be granted to the opponent(s) with respect to an auxiliary request before it is held allowable by an interlocutory decision (see D-VI, 7.2).

It is especially important to allow separate appeal where the continuation of the proceedings depends on a preliminary ruling on a fundamental point of law, e.g. where different boards of appeal have given different rulings or conflicting decisions have been given by different examining or opposition divisions and no decision on appeal has been given in the matter. Interlocutory decisions must state the reasons on which they are taken (see E-X, 1.3.3).

The examiner has the discretion to decide whether, in each particular case, the amendments to the claims are such that examination has to be continued on a new basis, e.g. where a completely new line of inventive-step argumentation would be necessary. In arriving at this decision, the examiner takes into account all the grounds mentioned in the original decision, including the main or supporting arguments already raised in previous objections to patentability to which the applicant has had an opportunity to respond and to which reference is made in the grounds of refusal (e.g. objections mentioned in previous communications, during personal consultation or at oral proceedings). This is in the interest of procedural efficiency and to the benefit of the applicant (no second appeal fee necessary, see T 2445/11). If amendments made to the independent claims clearly do not meet the requirements of Art. 123(2), interlocutory revision is not granted, but the division sends the file to the boards of appeal. If there are doubts as to whether the amendments meet the requirements of Art. 123(2) or the amendments clearly meet the requirements of Art. 123(2), the division checks whether the amended claims overcome the ground(s) for refusal as indicated above. Examples: (a) The applicant has included a wording that has already been suggested by the examiner, the new claims are ready for grant but the description needs to be adapted: interlocutory revision must be granted since the grounds for the refusal have been overcome. (b) Refusal for lack of novelty only. New claims are clearly novel but not inventive. The question of inventive step had not been raised in the decision or in the previous procedure: there must be an interlocutory revision. (c) Refusal for lack of novelty. New claim 1 filed which includes a feature from dependent claim 3. This claim had already been discussed in the decision and was considered not to be inventive: no interlocutory revision. (d) Refusal for lack of novelty over D1. New claim 1 filed which includes a feature from the description. This feature had not been previously discussed per se; however, it is clearly disclosed in D1: no interlocutory revision since the ground for refusal – lack of novelty over D1 – has not been overcome. (e) Refusal for lack of inventive step vis-à-vis D1 and D2. New claims filed which include a feature from the description. This feature had not been previously discussed, but is clearly disclosed in D1, and therefore there is no change in the argumentation given: no interlocutory revision since the ground for refusal – lack of inventive step vis-à-vis D1 and D2 – has not been overcome. (f) Refusal for lack of inventive step vis-à-vis D1 and D2. New claim filed which includes five new features from the description. These features have not been previously discussed. The examiner notes that although these features are disclosed in D2, the lack-of-inventive-step argumentation would have to be revised: interlocutory revision is allowed, since (i) the applicant has made substantial amendments to overcome the objections raised in the decision and (ii) the line of argumentation has to be revised. (g) Refusal for novelty vis-à-vis D1. New claims filed which clearly relate to unsearched subject-matter and which do not combine with the original searched claims to form a single general inventive concept: no interlocutory revision because said claims cannot be allowed in the proceedings. (T 919/95). Example: The main request is the same as the one refused (i.e. not amended). However, the auxiliary request corresponds to a suggestion made by the examining division and would thus be allowable. There can be no interlocutory revision since the applicant has the right to have the main request examined by the boards of appeal. Example: On the date of filing, the drawings did not comply with the requirements set by the President under Rule 49(2). The application was subsequently refused (Art. 90(5)) since the applicant filed the same poor-quality drawings in reply to the communication under Rule 58. When filing an appeal complying with the requirements of Art. 108, the applicant also files drawings of sufficient quality, thereby correcting the deficiency on which the refusal was based. Since the underlying ground for the refusal has been overcome and the reasoning in the decision under appeal no longer applies, the Receiving Section grants interlocutory revision and does not refer the case to the boards of appeal."

That department must therefore consider the appeal with the highest priority and start the examination on admissibility immediately, and if the appeal is considered admissible in the form in which it has been filed, the competent department will start its examination on allowability immediately. The department concerned will rectify its decision if convinced in the light of the grounds of appeal that the appeal is admissible and well founded. This could arise, for example, because: (i) the department failed to take due account of some of the material available to it at the time the decision was made; (ii) the department did not receive material filed at the EPO in due time before the issue of the decision, owing to an office error; or (iii) the decision of the department concerned does not appear to be incorrect, but the applicant presents new information or evidence or files amendments to the application, which overcome the objections of the decision under appeal (see T 139/87).

The examining division, however, checks whether a European patent is the \"subject of the action\". The examining division responsible for the technical opinion gives the parties an opportunity to submit arguments in writing if the court so permits. However, the parties have no right to be heard before the EPO. Nevertheless, where the examining division considers it necessary, it may invite the parties, via the court and provided that the court so permits, either to be heard before the examining division or to submit supplementary observations on specific points identified by the examining division. If the parties are heard, such a hearing is not considered to constitute oral proceedings within the meaning of Art. 116. The technical opinion is not a decision of the EPO. The parties to the national proceedings therefore have no right of appeal before the EPO against an unfavourable opinion."

On the other hand, the examining division will decline to make any specific statement on whether a patent is valid or on whether it is infringed. It also does not give any opinion on the extent of protection (Art. 69 and the accompanying Protocol). A request from a national court is to be expected to be clearly and precisely formulated, so that the examining division will be in no doubt as to the questions on which the court wishes to have an opinion. Since the court is responsible for deciding the issues of law involved in the questions and since most questions include a mixture of legal and technical aspects, the court is expected where possible to separate clearly the legal aspects from the technical aspects upon which it seeks the opinion of the EPO."

Where this is not practicable, the national court and the parties are informed of the proposed members of the examining division under Art. 25 and of which among these members participated in European examination or opposition proceedings on the case.

            "content": " Art. 72 is an autonomous provision which exclusively governs the formal requirements of such transfers. The EPO registers a transfer of rights in respect of a pending European patent application (see A-IV, 1.1.1 and J 10/93) in the European Patent Register on request, upon fulfilment of the prerequisites of Rule 22. The request is not deemed to have been filed until an administrative fee has been paid. The amount of the fee is determined by the latest schedule of fees and expenses of the EPO (see epo.org). Where the request relates to multiple applications, a separate fee has to be paid for each application. With effect from the entry into force of amended Rule 22(1) on 1 April 2024, the conditions under which payment of an administrative fee is due is laid down by the President of the EPO. Rule 22 furthermore requires the production of documents providing evidence of such a transfer. Any kind of written evidence suitable for proving the transfer is admissible. This includes formal documentary proof such as the instrument of transfer itself (the original or a copy thereof) or other official documents or extracts thereof, provided that they immediately verify the transfer (J 12/00). Art. 72 requires that, for an assignment, the signatures of the parties appear on the documents submitted as evidence of the transfer. Assignment documents filed electronically (see A-II, 1.1.1) may, instead of handwritten signatures, bear qualified electronic signatures (see notice from the EPO dated 22 October 2021; OJ EPO 2021, A86). With effect from the entry into force of amended Rule 22(1) on 1 April 2024, electronic signatures as determined by the President of the EPO are accepted on assignment documents. Where a document is signed on behalf of a legal person, only such persons as are entitled to sign by law, by the legal person's articles of association or equivalent or by a special mandate may do so. National law applies in that respect. In all cases, an indication of the signatory's entitlement to sign, e.g. his/her position within the legal entity where the entitlement to sign results directly from such a position, is to be given. The contracting parties have to ensure that the signatories are duly authorised in accordance with the national law applicable to sign such a document. The EPO, however, reserves the right to request documentary proof of the signatory's authority to sign if the circumstances of a particular case necessitate this. In such cases, if the evidence presented is found to be unsatisfactory, the EPO informs the party requesting the transfer accordingly and invites them to remedy the stated deficiency within a given time limit. As a general rule, the authorisation to represent a party in proceedings before the EPO within the meaning of Rule 152, be it an individual or a general authorisation, is not as such considered to empower the representative to enter into such a contract. If the request complies with the requirements of Rule 22(1), the transfer is registered with the date on which the request, the required evidence or the fee has been received by the EPO, whichever is the latest. In case of a minor deficiency, i.e. if all requirements were present but not fulfilled completely (e.g. the request was signed but the name and/or position of the person signing were missing), once rectified the effective date is the date of receipt of the original request for registration. On the above date, the transfer becomes effective vis-à-vis the EPO, i.e. from that date the newly registered applicant is entitled to exercise the right to the European patent application in proceedings before the EPO (Art. 60(3)). If the transfer was for certain designated states only, Art. 118 applies. Once a transfer has been duly entered in the European Patent Register, the registration cannot be undone, even if it appears that one or more requirements were actually not fulfilled for reasons not apparent at the time when the transfer was registered by the EPO, e.g. where doubts arise later as to the entitlement of the person signing on behalf of one of the parties to enter such a transfer agreement (see decisions J 16/14 to J 22/14). The original status quo is no longer restored until the valid legal situation has been established. In the meantime, proceedings may have to be stayed under Rule 14 or 78 until it is clear who the legitimate applicant/proprietor is."
