Although here we have four overlapping ranges, the ranges are neither narrower nor \nfar removed from the end-points of the known ranges. Please further note that feature (d) of claim \nII.1 is optional. Thus, claim II. 1 would not be new over D2.","question":"In an opposition procedure, an opponent will likely be successful with an attack under \nArticle 123(2) EPC against claim II.2.","answer":"TRUE","explanation":"The application explicitly states that when the releasing agent includes a modified siloxane, \nit should contain less than 1% w/w of colloidal silica (paragraph 6 of the description). Claim II.2, \nhowever, is not limited to comprise any colloidal silica, although the claimed erasable ink \ncomposition comprises a modified siloxane. An erasable ink composition comprising a modified \nsiloxane without any colloidal silica is not directly and unambiguously derivable from the application \nas originally filed."}
