A single date is fixed for the oral  proceedings. In order to help concentration on essentials during the oral proceedings, the Board shall issue  a communication drawing attention to matters  that seem to be of particular significance for the  decision to be taken. The Board may also provide a preliminary opinion. The Board shall endeavour to issue the communication at least  four months in advance of the date of the oral  proceedings.

If the party is  represented, the serious reasons must relate to  the representative. o (a) The request shall be filed in writing, reasoned and, where appropriate, supported by  documentary evidence. The request shall be  filed as soon as possible after the summons to  oral proceedings has been notified and the serious reasons in question have arisen. The request should include a list of dates on which the  requesting party is not available for oral proceedings. (b) Reasons which may justify a change of the  date for oral proceedings include: (i) notification of a summons to oral proceedings in other proceedings before the European  Patent Office or a national court received before  notification of the summons to oral proceedings  before the Board; (ii) serious illness; (iii) a death within the family; (iv) marriage or formation of a similar recognised partnership; (v) military service or other obligatory performance of civic duties; (vi) holidays or business trips which have been  firmly booked before notification of the summons to oral proceedings.

However, where  it has been indicated to the Board that a third  party or a court has, in the particular case, a legitimate interest in the reasons for the decision not being in abridged form, they shall not be  abridged.

(a) Where the Chair announces the decision on  the appeal orally in accordance with paragraph 6, the Board shall put the decision in writing and despatch it within three months of the  date of the oral proceedings.
